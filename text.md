INTRODUCTION
The Roseto Mystery
THESE PEOPLE WERE DYING OF OLD AGE. THAT'S IT.”
out-li-er \-,l•(-9)r\ noun i: something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main
or related body 2: a statistical observation that is markedly different in value from the others of
the sample.
Roseto Valfortore lies one hundred miles southeast of Rome in the Apennine foothills of the
Italian province of Foggia. In the style of medieval villages, the town is organized around a large
central square. Facing the square is the Palazzo Marchesale, the palace of the Saggese family,
once the great landowner of those parts. An archway to one side leads to a church, the
Madonna del CarmineOur Lady of Mount Carmine. Narrow stone steps run up the hillside,
flanked by closely clustered two-story stone houses with red-tile roofs.
For centuries, the paesani of Roseto worked in the marble quarries in the surrounding hills, or
cultivated the fields in the terraced valley below, walking four and five miles down the mountain
in the morning and then making the long journey back up the hill at night. Life was hard. The
townsfolk were barely literate and desperately poor and without much hope for economic
betterment until word reached Roseto at the end of the nineteenth century of the land of
opportunity across the ocean.
In January of 1882, a group of eleven Rosetansten men and one boyset sail for New York.
They spent their first night in America sleeping on the floor of a tavern on Mulberry Street, in
Manhattan's Little Italy. Then they ventured west, eventually finding jobs in a slate quarry ninety
miles west of the city near the town of Bangor, Pennsylvania. The following year, fifteen
Rosetans left Italy for America, and several members of that group ended up in Bangor as well,
joining their compatriots in the slate quarry. Those immigrants, in turn, sent word back to
Roseto about the promise of the New World, and soon one group of Rosetans after another
packed their bags and headed for Pennsylvania, until the initial stream of immigrants became a
flood. In 1894 alone, some twelve hundred Rosetans applied for passports to America, leaving
entire streets of their old village abandoned.
The Rosetans began buying land on a rocky hillside connected to Bangor by a steep, rutted
wagon path. They built closely clustered two-story stone houses with slate roofs on narrow
streets running up and down the hillside. They built a church and called it Our Lady of Mount
Carmel and named the main street, on which it stood, Garibaldi Avenue, after the great hero of Italian unification. In the beginning, they called their town
New Italy. But they soon changed it to Roseto, which seemed only appropriate given that
Page 2/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
almost all of them had come from the same village in Italy.
In 1896, a dynamic young priest by the name of Father Pasquale de Nisco took over at Our
Lady of Mount Carmel. De Nisco set up spiritual societies and organized festivals. He
encouraged the townsfolk to clear the land and plant onions, beans, potatoes, melons, and fruit
trees in the long backyards behind their houses. He gave out seeds and bulbs. The town came to
life. The Rosetans began raising pigs in their backyards and growing grapes for homemade
wine. Schools, a park, a convent, and a cemetery were built. Small shops and bakeries and
restaurants and bars opened along Garibaldi Avenue. More than a dozen factories sprang up
making blouses for the garment trade. Neighboring Bangor was largely Welsh and English, and
the next town over was overwhelmingly German, which meantgiven the fractious relationships
between the English and Germans and Italians in those yearsthat Roseto stayed strictly for
Rosetans. If you had wandered up and down the streets of Roseto in Pennsylvania in the first
few decades after 1900, you would have heard only Italian, and not just any Italian but the
precise southern Foggian dialect spoken back in the Italian Roseto. Roseto, Pennsylvania, was
its own tiny, selfsufficient worldall but unknown by the society around itand it might well have
remained so but for a man named Stewart Wolf.
Wolf was a physician. He studied digestion and the stomach and taught in the medical school at
the University of Oklahoma. He spent his summers on a farm in Pennsylvania, not far from
Roseto although that, of course, didn't mean much, since Roseto was so much in its own world
that it was possible to live in the next town and never know much about it. “One of the times
when we were up there for the summerthis would have been in the late nineteen fifties I was
invited to give a talk at the local medical society,” Wolf said years later in an interview. “After
the talk was over, one of the local doctors invited me to have a beer. And while we were having
a drink, he said, 'You know, I've been practicing for seventeen years. I get patients from all
over, and I rarely find anyone from Roseto under the age of sixty-five with heart disease.' ”
Wolf was taken aback. This was the 1950s, years before the advent of cholesterol-lowering
drugs and aggressive measures to prevent heart disease. Heart attacks were an epidemic in the
United States. They were the leading cause of death in men under the age of sixty-five. It was
impossible to be a doctor, common sense said, and not see heart disease.
Wolf decided to investigate. He enlisted the support of some of his students and colleagues from
Oklahoma. They gathered together the death certificates from residents of the town, going back
as many years as they could. They analyzed physicians' records. They took medical histories and
constructed family genealogies. “We got busy,” Wolf said. “W e decided to do a preliminary
study. We started in nineteen sixty-one. The mayor said, 'All my sisters are going to help you/
He had four sisters. He said, 'You can have the town council room/ I said, 'Where are you
going to have council meetings?' He said, 'Well, we'll postpone them for a while/ The ladies
would bring us lunch. We had little booths where we could take blood, do EKGs. We were there
for four weeks. Then I talked with the authorities. They gave us the school for the summer. We
invited the entire population of Roseto to be tested.”
The results were astonishing. In Roseto, virtually no one under fifty-five had died of a heart
attack or showed any signs of heart disease. For men over sixty-five, the death rate from heart
disease in Roseto was roughly half that of the United States as a whole. The death rate from all
causes in Roseto, in fact, was 30 to 35 percent lower than expected.
Page 3/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Wolf brought in a friend of his, a sociologist from Oklahoma named John Bruhn, to help him. “I
hired medical students and sociology grad students as interviewers, and in Roseto we went
house to house and talked to every person aged twenty-one and over,” Bruhn remembers. This
happened more than fifty years ago, but Bruhn still had a sense of amazement in his voice as he
described what they found. “There was no suicide, no alcoholism, no drug addiction, and very
little crime. They didn't have anyone on welfare. Then we looked at peptic ulcers. They didn't
have any of those either. These people were dying of old age. That's it.”
Wolf's profession had a name for a place like Rosetoa place that lay outside everyday
experience, where the normal rules did not apply. Roseto was an outlier.
Wolf's first thought was that the Rosetans must have held on to some dietary practices from the
Old World that left them healthier than other Americans. But he quickly real ized that wasn't
true. The Rosetans were cooking with lard instead of with the much healthier olive oil they had
used back in Italy. Pizza in Italy was a thin crust with salt, oil, and perhaps some tomatoes,
anchovies, or onions. Pizza in Pennsylvania was bread dough plus sausage, pepperoni, salami,
ham, and sometimes eggs. Sweets such as biscotti and taralli used to be reserved for Christmas
and Easter; in Roseto they were eaten year-round. When Wolf had dieticians analyze the typical
Rosetan's eating habits, they found that a whopping 41 percent of their calories came from fat.
Nor was this a town where people got up at dawn to do yoga and run a brisk six miles. The
Pennsylvanian Rosetans smoked heavily and many were struggling with obesity.
If diet and exercise didn't explain the findings, then what about geneticsThe Rosetans were a
close-knit group from the same region of Italy, and Wolf's next thought was to wonder whether
they were of a particularly hardy stock that protected them from disease. So he tracked down
relatives of the Rosetans who were living in other parts of the United States to see if they
shared the same remarkable good health as their cousins in Pennsylvania. They didn't.
He then looked at the region where the Rosetans lived. Was it possible that there was
something about living in the foothills of eastern Pennsylvania that was good for their healthThe
two closest towns to Roseto were Bangor,
which was just down the hill, and Nazareth, a few miles away. These were both about the same
size as Roseto, and both were populated with the same kind of hardworking European
immigrants. Wolf combed through both towns' medical records. For men over sixty-five, the
death rates from heart disease in Nazareth and Bangor were three times that of Roseto. A
nother dead end.
What Wolf began to realize was that the secret of Roseto wasn't diet or exercise or genes or
location. It had to be Roseto itself. As Bruhn and Wolf walked around the town, they figured out
why. They looked at how the Rosetans visited one another, stopping to chat in Italian on the
street, say, or cooking for one another in their backyards. They learned about the extended
family clans that underlay the town's social structure. They saw how many homes had three
generations living under one roof, and how much respect grandparents commanded. They went
to mass at Our Lady of Mount Carmel and saw the unifying and calming effect of the church.
They counted twenty-two separate civic organizations in a town of just under two thousand
people. They picked up on the particular egalitarian ethos of the community, which discouraged
Page 4/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
the wealthy from flaunting their success and helped the unsuccessful obscure their failures.
In transplanting the paesani culture of southern Italy to the hills of eastern Pennsylvania, the
Rosetans had created a powerful, protective social structure capable of insulating them from the
pressures of the modern world. The Rosetans were healthy because of where they were /row,
because of the world they had created for themselves in their tiny little town in the hills.
“I remember going to Roseto for the first time, and you'd see three-generational family meals,
all the bakeries, the people walking up and down the street, sitting on their porches talking to
each other, the blouse mills where the women worked during the day, while the men worked in
the slate quarries,” Bruhn said. “It was magical.”
When Bruhn and Wolf first presented their findings to the medical community, you can imagine
the kind of skepticism they faced. They went to conferences where their peers were presenting
long rows of data arrayed in complex charts and referring to this kind of gene or that kind of
physiological process, and they themselves were talking instead about the mysterious and
magical benefits of people stopping to talk to one another on the street and of having three
generations under one roof. Living a long life, the conventional wisdom at the time said,
depended to a great extent on who we werethat is, our genes. It depended on the decisions we
madeon what we chose to eat, and how much we chose to exercise, and how effectively we
were treated by the medical system. No one was used to thinking about health in terms of
community.
Wolf and Bruhn had to convince the medical establishment to think about health and heart
attacks in an entirely new way: they had to get them to realize that they wouldn't be able to
understand why someone was healthy if all they did was think about an individual's personal
choices or actions in isolation. They had to look beyond the individual. They had to understand
the culture he or she was a part of, and who their friends and families were, and what town their
families came from. They had to appreciate the idea that the values of the world we inhabit and
the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are.
In Outliers, I want to do for our understanding of success what Stewart Wolf did for our
understanding of health.

CHAPTER ONE
FOR UNTO EVERYONE THAT HATH SHALL BE GIVEN, AND HE SHALL HAVE
ABUNDANCE, BUT FROM HIM THAT HATH NOT SHALL BE TAKEN AWAY EVEN THAT
WHICH HE HATH.”
MATTHEW 25:29
1.
One warm, spring day in May of 2007,the Medicine Hat Tigers and the Vancouver Giants met
for the Memorial Cup hockey championships in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Tigers and
the Giants were the two finest teams in the Canadian Hockey League, which in turn is the finest
junior hockey league in the world. These were the future stars of the sportseventeen-,
eighteen-, and nineteenyear-olds who had been skating and shooting pucks since they were
barely more than toddlers.
The game was broadcast on Canadian national television. Up and down the streets of downtown
Vancouver, Memorial Cup banners hung from the lampposts. The arena was packed. A long
red carpet was rolled out on the ice, and the announcer introduced the game's dignitaries. First
came the premier of British Columbia, Gordon Campbell. Then, amid tumultuous applause, out
walked Gordie Howe, one of the legends of the game. “Ladies and gentlemen,” the announcer
boomed. “Mr. Hockey!”
For the next sixty minutes, the two teams played spirited, aggressive hockey. Vancouver scored
first, early in the second period, on a rebound by Mario Bliznak. Late in the second period, it
was Medicine Hat's turn, as the team's scoring leader, Darren Helm, fired a quick shot past
Vancouver's goalie, Tyson Sexsmith. Vancouver answered in the third period, scoring the
game's deciding goal, and then, when Medicine Hat pulled its goalie in desperation, Vancouver
scored a third time.
In the aftermath of the game, the players and their families and sports reporters from across the
country crammed into the winning team's locker room. The air was filled with cigar smoke and
the smell of champagne and sweat-soaked hockey gear. On the wall was a handpainted banner:
“Embrace the Struggle.” In the center of the room the Giants' coach, Don Hay, stood
mistyeyed. “I'm just so proud of these guys,” he said. “Just look around the locker room. There
isn't one guy who didn't buy in wholeheartedly.”
Canadian hockey is a meritocracy. Thousands of Canadian boys begin to play the sport at the
“novice” level, before they are even in kindergarten. From that point on, there are leagues for
every age class, and at each of those levels, the players are sifted and sorted and evaluated, with
the most talented separated out and groomed for the next level. By the time players reach their
midteens, the very best of the best have been channeled into an elite league known as Major
Junior A , which is the top of the pyramid. And if your Major Junior A team plays for the
Memorial Cup, that means you are at the very top of the top of the pyramid.
Page 6/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
This is the way most sports pick their future stars. It's the way soccer is organized in Europe and
South America, and it's the way Olympic athletes are chosen. For that matter, it is not all that
different from the way the world of classical music picks its future virtuosos, or the way the world
of ballet picks its future ballerinas, or the way our elite educational system picks its future
scientists and intellectuals.
You can't buy your way into Major Junior A hockey. It doesn't matter who your father or
mother is, or who your grandfather was, or what business your family is in. Nor does it matter if
you live in the most remote corner of the most northerly province in Canada. If you have ability,
the vast network of hockey scouts and talent spotters will find you, and if you are willing to work
to develop that ability, the system will reward you. Success in hockey is based on individual
meritand both of those words are important. Players are judged on their own performance, not
on anyone else's, and on the basis of their ability, not on some other arbitrary fact.
Or are they?
2.
This is a book about outliers, about men and women who do things that are out of the ordinary.
Over the course of the chapters ahead, I'm going to introduce you to one kind of outlier after
another: to geniuses, business tycoons, rock stars, and software programmers. We're going to
uncover the secrets of a remarkable lawyer, look at what separates the very best pilots from
pilots who have crashed planes, and try to figure out why Asians are so good at math. And in
examining the lives of the remarkable among usthe skilled, the talented, and the drivenI will
argue that there is something profoundly wrong with the way we make sense of success.
What is the question we always ask about the successfulWe want to know what they're likewhat
kind of personalities they have, or how intelligent they are, or what kind of lifestyles they have,
or what special talents they might have been born with. And we assume that it is those personal
qualities that explain how that individual reached the top.
In the autobiographies published every year by the billionaire/entrepreneur/rock star/celebrity,
the story line is always the same: our hero is born in modest circumstances and by virtue of his
own grit and talent fights his way to greatness. In the Bible, Joseph is cast out by his brothers
and sold into slavery and then rises to become the pharaoh's right-hand man on the strength of
his own brilliance and insight. In the famous nineteenth-century novels of Horatio Alger, young
boys born into poverty rise to riches through a combination of pluck and initiative. “I think
overall it's a disadvantage,” Jeb Bush once said of what it meant for his business career that he
was the son of an American president and the brother of an American president and the
grandson of a wealthy Wall Street banker and US senator. When he ran for governor of Florida,
he repeatedly referred to himself as a “self-made man,” and it is a measure of how deeply we
associate success with the efforts of the individual that few batted an eye at that description.
“Lift up your heads,” RobertWinthrop told the crowd many years ago at the unveiling of a statue
of that great hero of American independence Benjamin Franklin, “and look at the image of a
man who rose from nothing, who owed nothing to parentage or patronage, who enjoyed no
advantages of early education which are not opena hundredfold opento yourselves, who
performed the most menial services in the businesses in which his early life was employed, but
Page 7/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
who lived to stand before Kings, and died to leave a name which the world will never forget.”
In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal explanations of success don't
work. People don't rise from nothing. W e do owe something to parentage and patronage. The
people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are
invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural
legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others
cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the
legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we
cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words.
It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and
who doesn't.
Biologists often talk about the “ecology” of an organism: the tallest oak in the forest is the tallest
not just because it grew from the hardiest acorn; it is the tallest also because no other trees
blocked its sunlight, the soil around it was deep and rich, no rabbit chewed through its bark as a
sapling, and no lumberjack cut it down before it matured. We all know that successful people
come from hardy seeds. But do we know enough about the sunlight that warmed them, the soil
in which they put down the roots, and the rabbits and lumberjacks they were lucky enough to
avoidThis is not a book about tall trees. It's a book about forests and hockey is a good place to
start because the explanation for who gets to the top of the hockey world is a lot more
interesting and complicated than it looks. In fact, it's downright peculiar.
3.
Do you see itDon't feel bad if you don't, because for many years in the hockey world no one
did. It wasn't until the mid-1980s, in fact, that a Canadian psychologist named Roger Barnsley
first drew attention to the phenomenon of relative age.
Barnsley was at a Lethbridge Broncos hockey game in southern Alberta, a team that played in
the same Major Junior A league as the Vancouver Giants and the Medicine Hat Tigers. He was
there with his wife, Paula, and their two boys, and his wife was reading the program, when she
ran across a roster list just like the one above that you just looked at.
“Roger,” she said, “do you know when these young men were born?”
Barnsley said yes. “They're all between sixteen and twenty, so they'd be born in the late
sixties.”
“No, no,” Paula went on. “What month.”
“I thought she was crazy,” Barnsley remembers. “But I looked through it, and what she was
saying just jumped out at me. For some reason, there were an incredible number of January,
February, and March birth dates.”
Barnsley went home that night and looked up the birth dates of as many professional hockey
players as he could find. He saw the same pattern. Barnsley, his wife, and a colleague, A. H.
Thompson, then gathered statistics on every player in the Ontario Junior Hockey League. The
story was the same. More players were born in January than in any other month, and by an
Page 8/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
overwhelming margin. The second most frequent birth monthFebruary. The third March.
Barnsley found that there were nearly five and a half times as many Ontario Junior Hockey
League players born in January as were born in November. He looked at the all-star teams of
eleven-year-olds and thirteen-yearoldsthe young players selected for elite traveling squads. Same
story. He looked at the composition of the National Hockey League. Same story. The more he
looked, the more Barnsley came to believe that what he was seeing was not a chance
occurrence but an iron law of Canadian hockey:
in any elite group of hockey playersthe very best of the best40 percent of the players will have
been born between January and March, 30 percent between April and June, 20 percent
between July and September, and 10 percent between October and December.
“In all my years in psychology, I have never run into an effect this large,” Barnsley says. “You
don't even need to do any statistical analysis. You just look at it.”
Look back at the Medicine Hat roster. Do you see it nowSeventeen out of the twenty-five
players on the team were born in January, February, March, or April.
Here is the play-by-play for the first two goals in the Memorial Cup final, only this time I've
substituted the players' birthdays for their names. It no longer sounds like the championship of
Canadian junior hockey. It now sounds like a strange sporting ritual for teenage boys born under
the astrological signs Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.
March 11 starts around one side of the Tigers' net, leaving the puck for his teammate January
4, who passes it to January 22, who flips it hack to March 12, who shoots point-blank at the
Tigers' goalie, April 27. April 27 blocks the shot, but it's rebounded by Vancouver's March 6.
He shoots! Medicine Hat defensemen February 9 and February 14 dive to block the puck while
January 10 looks on helplessly. March 6 scores!
Let's go to the second period now.
Medicine Hat's turn. The Tigers' scoring leader, January 21, charges down the right side of the
ice. He stops and circles, eluding the Vancouver defenseman February 15. January 21 then
deftly passes the puck to his teammate December 20wow! what's he doing out there f!who
shrugs off the onrushing defender May 17 and slides a cross-crease pass back to January 21. He
shoots! Vancouver defenseman March 12 dives, trying to block the shot. Vancouver's goalie,
March 19, lunges helplessly. January 21 scores! He raises his hands in triumph. His teammate
May 2jumps on his back with joy.
4.
The explanation for this is quite simple. It has nothing to do with astrology, nor is there anything
magical about the first three months of the year. It's simply that in Canada the eligibility cutoff
for age-class hockey is January i. A boy who turns ten on January 2, then, could be playing
alongside someone who doesn't turn ten until the end of the yearand at that age, in
preadolescence, a twelvemonth gap in age represents an enormous difference in physical
maturity.
This being Canada, the most hockey-crazed country on earth, coaches start to select players for
Page 9/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
the traveling “rep” squadthe all-star teamsat the age of nine or ten, and of course they are more
likely to view as talented the bigger and more coordinated players, who have had the benefit of
critical extra months of maturity.
And what happens when a player gets chosen for a rep squadHe gets better coaching, and his
teammates are better, and he plays fifty or seventy-five games a season instead of twenty games
a season like those left behind in the “house” league, and he practices twice as much as, or
even three times more than, he would have otherwise. In the beginning, his advantage isn't so
much that he is inherently better but only that he is a little older. But by the age of thirteen or
fourteen, with the benefit of better coaching and all that extra practice under his belt, he really is
better, so he's the one more likely to make it to the Major Junior A league, and from there into
the big leagues.“”
Barnsley argues that these kinds of skewed age distributions exist whenever three things
happen: selection, streaming, and differentiated experience. If you make a decision about who
is good and who is not good at an early age; if you separate the “talented” from the
“untalented”; and if you provide the “talented” with a superior experience, then you're going to
end up giving a huge advantage to that small group of people born closest to the cutoff date.
In the United States, football and basketball don't select, stream, and differentiate quite as
dramatically. As * The way Canadians select hockey players is a beautiful example of what the
sociologist Robert Merton famously called a “selffulfilling prophecy”a situation where “a false
definition, in the beginning...evokes a new behavior which makes the original false conception
come true.” Canadians start with a false definition of who the best nine and ten-year-old hockey
players are. They're just picking the oldest every year. But the way they treat those “all-stars”
ends up making their original false judgment look correct. As Merton puts it: “This specious
validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the
actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.”
a result, a child can be a bit behind physically in those sports and still play as much as his or her
more mature peers.“” But baseball does. The cutoff date for almost all nonschool baseball
leagues in the United States is July 31, with the result that more major league players are born
in August than in any other month. (The numbers are striking: in 2005, among Americans
playing major league baseball 505 were born in August versus 313born in July.)
European soccer, similarly, is organized like hockey and baseballand the birth-date distributions
in that sport are heavily skewed as well. In England, the eligibility date is September 1, and in
the football association's premier league at one point in the 1990s, there were 288 players
born between September and November and only 136 players born between June and August.
In international soccer, the cutoff date used to be August 1, and in one recent junior world
championship tournament, 135 players were born in the three months after August 1, and just
22 were born in May, June, and July. Today the cutoff date for international junior soccer is
January 1. T ake a look at the roster of the 2007 Czechoslovakian National Junior soccer team,
which made the Junior World Cup finals.
Here we go again:
* A physically immature basketball player in an American city can probably play as many hours
Page 10/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
of basketball in a given year as a relatively older child because there are so many basketball
courts and so many people willing to play. It's not like ice hockey, where you need a rink.
Basketball is saved by its accessibility and ubiquity.
At the national team tryouts, the Czech soccer coaches might as well have told everyone born
after midsummer that they should pack their bags and go home.
Hockey and soccer are just games, of course, involving a select few. But these exact same
biases also show up in areas of much more consequence, like education. Parents with a child
born at the end of the calendar year often think about holding their child back before the start of
kindergarten: it's hard for a five-year-old to keep up with a child born many months earlier. But
most parents, one suspects, think that whatever disadvantage a younger child faces in
kindergarten eventually goes away. But it doesn't. It's just like hockey. The small initial
advantage that the child born in the early part of the year has over the child born at the end of
the year persists. It locks children into patterns of achievement and underachievement,
encouragement and discouragement, that stretch on and on for years.
Recently, two economists Kelly Bedard and Elizabeth Dhueylooked at the relationship between
scores on what is called the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, or TIMSS
(math and science tests given every four years to children in many countries around the world),
and month of birth. They found that among fourth graders, the oldest children scored
somewhere between four and twelve percentile points better than the youngest children. That,
as Dhuey explains, is a “huge effect.” It means that if you take two intellectually equivalent
fourth graders with birthdays at opposite ends of the cutoff date, the older student could score in
the eightieth percentile, while the younger one could score in the sixty-eighth percentile. That's
the difference between qualifying for a gifted program and not.
“It's just like sports,” Dhuey said. “W e do ability grouping early on in childhood. We have
advanced reading groups and advanced math groups. So, early on, if we look at young kids, in
kindergarten and first grade, the teachers are confusing maturity with ability. And they put the
older kids in the advanced stream, where they learn better skills; and the next year, because
they are in the higher groups, they do even better; and the next year, the same things happens,
and they do even better again. The only country we don't see this going on is Denmark. They
have a national policy where they have no ability grouping until the age of ten.” Denmark waits
to make selection decisions until maturity differences by age have evened out.
Dhuey and Bedard subsequently did the same analysis, only this time looking at college. What
did they findAt four-year colleges in the United Statesthe highest stream of postsecondary
educationstudents belonging to the relatively youngest group in their class are underrepresented
by about 11.6 percent. That initial difference in maturity doesn't go away with time. It persists.
And for thousands of students, that initial disadvantage is the difference between going to
collegeand having a real shot at the middle classand not.*
“I mean, it's ridiculous,” Dhuey says. "It's outlandish that our arbitrary choice of cutoff dates is
causing * Even more social phenomena can be linked to relative age. Barnsley and two
colleagues, for instance, once found that students who attempt suicide are also more likely to be
born in the second half of the school year. Their explanation is that poorer school performance
can lead to depression. The connection between relative age and sui cide, however, isn't nearly
Page 11/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
as pronounced as the correlation between birth date and athletic success.
these long-lasting effects, and no one seems to care about them."
5.
Think for a moment about what the story of hockey and early birthdays says about success.
It tells us that our notion that it is the best and the brightest who effortlessly rise to the top is
much too simplistic. Yes, the hockey players who make it to the profes sional level are more
talented than you or me. But they also got a big head start, an opportunity that they neither
deserved nor earned. And that opportunity played acritical role in their success.
The sociologist Robert Merton famously called this phenomenon the “Matthew Effect” after the
New Testament verse in the Gospel of Matthew: “For unto everyone that hath shall be given,
and he shall have abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which
he hath.” It is those who are successful, in other words, who are most likely to be given the
kinds of special opportunities that lead to further success. It's the rich who get the biggest tax
breaks. It's the best students who get the best teaching and most attention. And it's the biggest
nineand ten-year-olds who get the most coaching and practice. Success is the result of what
sociologists like to call “accumulative advantage.” The professional hockey player starts out a
little bit better than his peers. And that little difference leads to an opportunity that makes that
difference a bit bigger, and that edge in turn leads to another opportunity, which makes the
initially small difference bigger stilland on and on until the hockey player is a genuine outlier. But
he didn't start out an outlier. He started out just a little bit better.
The second implication of the hockey example is that the systems we set up to determine who
gets ahead aren't particularly efficient. We think that starting all-star leagues and gifted programs
as early as possible is the best way of ensuring that no talent slips through the cracks. But take a
look again at that roster for the Czech Republic soccer team. There are no players born in July,
October, November, or December, and only one each in August and September. Those born in
the last half of the year have all been discouraged, or overlooked, or pushed out of the sport.
The talent of essentially half of the Czech athletic population has been squandered.
So what do you do if you're an athletic young Czech with the misfortune to have been born in
the last part of the yearYou can't play soccer. The deck is stacked against you. So maybe you
could play the other sport that Czechs are obsessed withhockey. But wait. (I think you know
what's coming.) Here's the roster of the 2007 Czech junior hockey team that finished fifth at
the world championships.
Those born in the last quarter of the year might as well give up on hockey too.
Do you see the consequences of the way we have chosen to think about successBecause we so
profoundly personalize success, we miss opportunities to lift others onto the top rung. We make
rules that frustrate achievement. We prematurely write off people as failures. We are too much
in awe of those who succeed and far too dismissive of those who fail. And, most of all, we
become much too passive. We overlook just how large a role we all playand by “we” I mean
societyin determining who makes it and who doesn't.
Page 12/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
If we chose to, we could acknowledge that cutoff dates matter. We could set up two or even
three hockey leagues, divided up by month of birth. Let the players develop on separate tracks
and then pick all-star teams.If all the Czech and Canadian athletes born at the end of the year
had a fair chance, then the Czech and the Canadian national teams suddenly would have twice
as many athletes to choose from.
Schools could do the same thing. Elementary and middle schools could put the January through
A pril-born students in one class, the May through August in another class, and those born in
September through December in the third class. They could let students learn with and compete
against other students of the same maturity level. It would be a little bit more complicated
administratively. But it wouldn't necessarily cost that much more money, and it would level the
playing field for those whothrough no fault of their ownhave been dealt a big disadvantage by
the educational system. We could easily take control of the machinery of achievement, in other
wordsnot just in sports but, as we will see, in other more consequential areas as well. But we
don't. And whyBecause we cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit
and that the world in which we all grow up and the rules we choose to write as a society don't
matter at all.

Before the Memorial Cup final, Gord Wasdenthe father of one of the Medicine Hat Tigersstood
by the side of the ice, talking about his son Scott. He was wearing a Medicine Hat baseball cap
and a black Medicine Hat T-shirt. “When he was four and five years old,” Wasden remembered,
“his little brother was in a walker, and he would shove a hockey stick in his hand and they would
play hockey on the floor in the kitchen, morning till night. Scott always had a passion for it. He
played rep hockey throughout his minor-league hockey career. He always made the Triple A
teams. As a first-year peewee or a firstyear bantam, he always played on the [top] rep team.” W
asden was clearly nervous: his son was about to play in the biggest game of his life. “He's had to
work very hard for whatever he's got. I'm very proud of him.”
Those were the ingredients of success at the highest level: passion, talent, and hard work. But
there was another element. When did Wasden first get the sense that his son was something
special“You know, he was always a bigger kid for his age. He was strong, and he had a knack
for scoring goals at an early age. And he was always kind of a standout for his age, a captain of
his team ”
Bigger kid for his ageO f course he was. Scott W asden was born on January 4, within three
days of the absolute perfect birthday for an elite hockey player. He was one of the lucky ones. If
the eligibility date for Canadian hockey were later in the year, he might have been watching the
Memorial Cup championship from the stands instead of playing on the ice.

CHAPTER TWO
The 10,000-Hour Rule “IN HAMBURG, WE HAD TO PLAY FOR EIGHT HOURS.”
1.
The University of Michigan opened its new Computer Center in 1971, in a brand-new building
on Beal Avenue in Ann Arbor, with beige-brick exterior walls and a dark-glass front. The
university's enormous mainframe computers stood in the middle of a vast white room, looking,
as one faculty member remembers, “like one of the last scenes in the movie 2001: A Space
Odyssey” Off to the side were dozens of keypunch machineswhat passed in those days for
computer terminals. In 1971, this was state of the art. The University of Michigan had one of
the most advanced computer science programs in the world, and over the course of the
Computer Center's life, thousands of students passed through that white room, the most famous
of whom was a gawky teenager named Bill Joy.
Joy came to the University of Michigan the year the Computer Center opened. He was sixteen.
He was tall and very thin, with a mop of unruly hair. Fie had been voted “Most Studious
Student” by his graduating class at North Farmington High School, outside Detroit, which, as he
puts it, meant that he was a “no-date nerd.” He had thought he might end up as biologist or a
mathematician. But late in his freshman year, he stumbled across the Computer Centerand he
was hooked.
From that point on, the Computer Center was his life. He programmed whenever he could. Joy
got a job with a computer science professor so he could program over the summer. In 1975, he
enrolled in graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley. There, he buried himself
even deeper in the world of computer software. During the oral exams for his PhD, he made up
a particularly complicated algorithm on the fly that, as one of his many admirers has written, “so
stunned his examiners [that] one of them later compared the experience to 'Jesus confounding
his elders/ ”
Working in collaboration with a small group of programmers,Joy took on the task ofrewriting
UNIX, which was a software system developed by A T&T for mainframe computers. Joy's
version was very good. It was so good, in fact, that it becameand remainsthe operating system
on which literally millions of computers around the world run. “If you put your Mac in that funny
mode where you can see the code,” Joy says, “I see things that I remember typing in twentyfive years ago.” And do you know who wrote much of the software that allows you to access the
InternetBill Joy.
After graduating from Berkeley, Joy cofounded the Silicon Valley firm Sun Microsystems, which
was one of the most critical players in the computer revolution. There he rewrote another
computer languageJavaand his legend grew still further. Among Silicon Valley insiders, Joy is
spoken of with as much awe as someone like Bill Gates of Microsoft. He is sometimes called the
Edison of the Internet. As the Yale computer scientist David Gelernter says, "Bill Joy is one of
the most influential people in the modern history of computing/'
Page 14/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
The story of Bill Joy's genius has been told many times, and the lesson is always the same. Here
was a world that was the purest of meritocracies. Computer programming didn't operate as an
old-boy network, where you got ahead because of money or connections. It was a wide-open
field in which all participants were judged solely on their talent and their accomplishments. It
was a world where the best men won, and Joy was clearly one of those best men.
It would be easier to accept that version of events, however, if we hadn't just looked at hockey
and soccer players. Theirs was supposed to be apure meritocracy as well. Only it wasn't. It was
a story of how the outliers in a particular field reached their lofty status through a combination of
ability, opportunity, and utterly arbitrary advantage.
Is it possible the same pattern of special opportunities operate in the real world as wellLet's go
back over the story of Bill Joy and find out.
2.
For almost a generation, psychologists around the world have been engaged in a spirited debate
over a question that most of us would consider to have been settled years ago. The question is
this: is there such a thing as innate talentThe obvious answer is yes. Not every hockey player
born in January ends up playing at the professional level. Only some dothe innately talented
ones. Achievement is talent plus preparation. The problem with this view is that the closer
psychologists look at the careers of the gifted, the smaller the role innate talent seems to play
and the bigger the role preparation seems to play.
Exhibit A in the talent argument is a study done in the early 1990s by the psychologist K.
Anders Ericsson and two colleagues at Berlin's elite Academy of Music. With the help of the
Academy's professors, they divided the school's violinists into three groups. In the first group
were the stars, the students with the potential to become world-class soloists. In the second
were those judged to be merely “good.” In the third were students who were unlikely to ever
play professionally and who intended to be music teachers in the public school system. All of the
violinists were then asked the same question: over the course of your entire career, ever since
you first picked up the violin, how many hours have you practiced?
Everyone from all three groups started playing at roughly the same age, around five years old. In
those first few years, everyone practiced roughly the same amount, about two or three hours a
week. But when the students were around the age of eight, real differences started to emerge.
The students who would end up the best in their class began to practice more than everyone
else: six hours a week by age nine, eight hours a week by age twelve, sixteen hours a week by
age fourteen, and up and up, until by the age of twenty they were practicingthat is, purposefully
and single-mindedly playing their instruments with the intent to get betterwell over thirty hours a
week. In fact, by the age of twenty, the elite performers had each totaled ten thousand hours of
practice. By contrast, the merely good students had totaled eight thousand hours, and the future
music teachers had totaled just over four thousand hours.
Ericsson and his colleagues then compared amateur pianists with professional pianists. The
same pattern emerged. The amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week over
the course of their childhood, and by the age of twenty they had totaled two thousand hours of
practice. The professionals, on the other hand, steadily increased their practice time every year,
Page 15/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
until by the age of twenty they, like the violinists, had reached ten thousand hours.
The striking thing about Ericsson's study is that he and his colleagues couldn't find any
“naturals,” musicians who floated effortlessly to the top while practicing a fraction of the time
their peers did. Nor could they find any “grinds,” people who worked harder than everyone
else, yet just didn't have what it takes to break the top ranks. Their research suggestes that once
a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one
performer from another is how hard he or she works. That's it. And what's more, the people at
the very top don't work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much,
much harder.
The idea that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of
practice surfaces again and again in studies of expertise. In fact, researchers have settled on
what they believe is the magic number for true expertise: ten thousand hours.
“The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to
achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expertin anything,” writes the
neurologist Daniel Levitin. “In study after study, of composers, basketball players, fiction writers,
ice skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals, and what have you, this number
comes up again and again. O f course, this doesn't address why some people get more out of
their practice sessions than others do. But no one has yet found a case in which true worldclass
expertise was accomplished in less time. It seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all
that it needs to know to achieve true mastery.”
This is true even of people we think of as prodigies. Mozart, for example, famously started
writing music at six. But, writes the psychologist Michael Howe in his book Genius Explained,
by the standards of mature composers, Mozart's early works are not outstanding. The earliest
pieces were all probably written down by his father, and perhaps improved in the process. Many
of Wolfgang's childhood compositions, such as the first seven of his concertos for piano and
orchestra, are largely arrangements of works by other composers. Of those concertos that only
contain music original to Mozart, the earliest that is now regarded as a masterwork (No. 9, K.
271) was not composed until he was twenty-one: by that time Mozart had already been composing concertos for
ten years.
The music critic Harold Schonberg goes further: Mozart, he argues, actually “developed late,”
since he didn't produce his greatest work until he had been composing for more than twenty
years.
To become a chess grandmaster also seems to take about ten years. (Only the legendary Bobby
Fischer got to that elite level in less than that amount of time: it took him nine years.) And
what's ten yearsWell, it's roughly how long it takes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice.
Ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness.
Here is the explanation for what was so puzzling about the rosters of the Czech and Canadian
national sports teams. There was practically no one on those teams born after September 1,
which doesn't seem to make any sense. You'd think that there should be a fair number of Czech
Page 16/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
hockey or soccer prodigies born late in the year who are so talented that they eventually make
their way into the top tier as young adults, despite their birth dates.
But to Ericsson and those who argue against the primacy of talent, that isn't surprising at all.
That late-born prodigy doesn't get chosen for the all-star team as an eight-year-old because he's
too small. So he doesn't get the extra practice. And without that extra practice, he has no
chance at hitting ten thousand hours by the time the professional hockey teams start looking for
players. And without ten thousand hours under his belt, there is no way he can ever master the
skills necessary to play at the top level. Even Mozartthe greatest musical prodigy of all time
couldn't hit his stride until he had his ten thousand hours in. Practice isn't the thing you do once
you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good.
The other interesting thing about that ten thousand hours, of course, is that ten thousand hours
is an enormous amount of time. It's all but impossible to reach that number all by yourself by the
time you're a young adult. You have to have parents who encourage and support you. You can't
be poor, because if you have to hold down a part-time job on the side to help make ends meet,
there won't be time left in the day to practice enough. In fact, most people can reach that
number only if they get into some kind of special programlike a hockey all-star squador if they
get some kind of extraordinary opportunity that gives them a chance to put in those hours.
3.
So, back to Bill Joy. It's 1971. He's tall and gawky and sixteen years old. He's the math whiz,
the kind of student that schools like M I T and Caltech and the University of Waterloo attract by
the hundreds. “When Bill was a little kid, he wanted to know everything about everything way
before he should've even known he wanted to know,” his father, William, says. “We answered
him when we could. And when we couldn't, we would just give him a book.” When it came time
to apply to college, Joy got a perfect score on the math portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
“It wasn't particularly hard,” he says matter-of-factly. “There was plenty of time to check it
twice.”
He has talent by the truckload. But that's not the only consideration. It never is. The key to his
development is that he stumbled across that nondescript building on Beal A venue.
In the early 1970s, when Joy was learning about programming, computers were the size of
rooms. A single machine (which might have less power and memory than your microwave now
has) could cost upwards of a million dollarsand that's in 1970s dollars. Computers were rare. If
you found one, if was hard to get access to it; if you managed to get access, renting time on it
cost a fortune.
What's more, programming itself was extraordinarily tedious. This was the era when computer
programs were created using cardboard punch cards. Each line of code was imprinted on the
card using a keypunch machine. A complex program might include hundreds, if not thousands,
of these cards in tall stacks. Once a program was ready, you walked over to whatever mainframe
computer you had access to and gave the stack of cards to an operator. Since computers could
handle only one task at a time, the operator made an appointment for your program, and
depending on how many people were ahead of you in line, you might not get your cards back
for a few hours or even a day. And if you made even a single erroreven a typographical errorin
Page 17/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
your program, you had to take the cards back, track down the error, and begin the whole
process again.
Under those circumstances, it was exceedingly difficult for anyone to become a programming
expert. Certainly becoming an expert by your early twenties was all but impossible. When you
can “program” for only a few minutes out of every hour you spend in the computer room, how
can you ever get in ten thousand hours of practice“Programming with cards,” one computer
scientist from that era remembers, “did not teach you programming. It taught you patience and
proofreading.”
It wasn't until the mid-1960s that a solution to the programming problem emerged. Computers
were finally powerful enough that they could handle more than one “appointment” at once. If
the computer's operating system was rewritten, computer scientists realized, the machine's time
could be shared; the computer could be trained to handle hundreds of tasks at the same time.
That, in turn, meant that programmers didn't have to physically hand their stacks of computer
cards to the operator anymore. Dozens of terminals could be built, all linked to the mainframe
by a telephone line, and everyone could be workingonlineall at once.
Here is how one history of the period describes the advent of time-sharing:
This was not just a revolution. It was a revelation. Forget the operator, the card decks, the wait.
With time-sharing, you could sit at your Teletype, bang in a couple of com mands, and get an
answer then and there. Time-sharing was interactive: A program could ask for a response, wait
for you to type it in, act on it while you waited, and show you the result, all in “real time.”
This is where Michigan came in, because Michigan was one of the first universities in the world
to switch over to time-sharing. By 1967, a prototype of the system was up and running. By the
early 1970s, Michigan had enough computing power that a hundred people could be
programming simultaneously in the Computer Center. “In the late sixties, early seventies, I don't
think there was anyplace else that was exactly like Michigan,” Mike Alexander, one of the
pioneers of Michigan's computing system, said. “Maybe MIT. Maybe Carnegie Mellon.Maybe
Dartmouth. I don't think there were any others.”
This was the opportunity that greeted Bill Joy when he arrived on the Ann Arbor campus in the
fall of 1971. He hadn't chosen Michigan because of its computers. He had never done anything
with computers in high school. He was interested in math and engineering. But when the
programming bug hit him in his freshman year, he found himselfby the happiest of accidentsin
one of the few places in the world where a seventeen-year-old could program all he wanted.
“Do you know what the difference is between the computing cards and time-sharing?” Joy says.
“It's the difference between playing chess by mail and speed chess.” Programming wasn't an
exercise in frustration anymore. It was fun.
“I lived in the north campus, and the Computer Center was in the north campus,” Joy went on.
"How much time did I spend thereOh, a phenomenal amount of time. It was open twenty-four
hours. I would stay there all night, and just walk home in the morning. In an average week in
those years, I was spending more time in the Computer Center than on my classes. A ll of us
down there had this recurring nightmare of forgetting to show up for class at all, of not even
realizing we were enrolled.
Page 18/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
“The challenge was that they gave all the students an account with a fixed amount of money, so
your time would run out. When you signed on, you would put in how long you wanted to spend
on the computer. They gave you, like, an hour of time. That's all you'd get. But someone
figured out that if you put in 'time equals' and then a letter, like t equals k, they wouldn't charge
you,“ he said, laughing at the memory. ”It was a bug in the soft ware. You could put in t equals
k and sit there forever.”
Just look at the stream of opportunities that came Bill Joy's way. Because he happened to go to
a farsighted school like the University of Michigan, he was able to practice on a time-sharing
system instead of with punch cards; because the Michigan system happened to have a bug in it,
he could program all he wanted; because the university was willing to spend the money to keep
the Computer Center open twenty-four hours, he could stay up all night; and because he was
able to put in so many hours, by the time he happened to be presented with the opportunity to
rewrite UNIX, he was up to the task. Bill Joy was brilliant. He wanted to learn. That was a big
part of it. But before he could become an expert, someone had to give him the opportunity to
learn how to be an expert.
“At Michigan, I was probably programming eight or ten hours a day,” he went on. “By the time
I was at Berkeley I was doing it day and night. I had a terminal at home. I'd stay up until two or
three o'clock in the morning, watching old movies and programming. Sometimes I'd fall asleep
at the keyboard”he mimed his head falling on the keyboard“and you know how the key repeats
until the end, and it starts to go beep, beep, beepAfter that happens three times, you have to
go to bed. I was still relatively incompetent even when I got to Berkeley. I was proficient by my
second year there. That's when I wrote programs that are still in use today, thirty years later.“
He paused for a moment to do the math in his headwhich for someone like Bill Joy doesn't take
very long. Michigan in 1971. Programming in earnest by sophomore year. Add in the summers,
then the days and nights in his first year at Berkeley. ”So, so maybe... ten thousand hours?“ he
said, finally. ”That's about right.”
4.
Is the ten-thousand-hour rule a general rule of successIf we scratch below the surface of every
great achiever, do we always find the equivalent of the Michigan Computer Center or the
hockey all-star teamsome sort of special opportunity for practice?
Let's test the idea with two examples, and for the sake of simplicity, let's make them as familiar
as possible: the Beatles, one of the most famous rock bands ever; and Bill Gates, one of the
world's richest men.
The BeatlesJohn Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starrcame to the
United States in February of 1964, starting the so-called British Invasion of the American music
scene and putting out a string of hit records that transformed the face of popular music.
The first interesting thing about the Beatles for our purposes is how long they had already been
together by the time they reached the United States. Lennon and McCartney first started
playing together in 1957, seven years prior to landing in America. (Incidentally, the time that
elapsed between their founding and their arguably greatest artistic achievementsSgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Beatles [White Album]is ten years.) And if you look even
Page 19/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
more closely at those long years of preparation, you'll find an experience that, in the context of
hockey players and Bill Joy and world-class violinists, sounds awfully familiar. In i960, while they
were still just a struggling high school rock band, they were invited to play in Hamburg,
Germany.
“Hamburg in those days did not have rock-and-roll music clubs. It had strip clubs,” says Philip
Norman, who wrote the Beatles biography Shout! "There was one particular club owner called
Bruno, who was originally a fairground showman. He had the idea of bringing in rock groups to
play in various clubs. They had this formula. It was a huge nonstop show, hour after hour, with a
lot of people lurching in and the other lot lurching out. And the bands would play all the time to
catch the passing traffic. In an American redlight district, they would call it nonstop striptease.
“Many of the bands that played in Hamburg were from Liverpool,” Norman went on. “It was an
accident. Bruno went to London to look for bands. But he happened to meet an entrepreneur
from Liverpool in Soho who was down in London by pure chance. And he arranged to send
some bands over. That's how the connection was established. And eventually the Beatles made
a connection not just with Bruno but with other club owners as well. They kept going back
because they got a lot of alcohol and a lot of sex.”
And what was so special about HamburgIt wasn't that it paid well. It didn't. Or that the acoustics
were fantastic. They weren't. Or that the audiences were savvy and appreciative. They were
anything but. It was the sheer amount of time the band was forced to play.
Here is John Lennon, in an interview after the Beatles disbanded, talking about the band's
performances at a Hamburg strip club called the Indra:
We got better and got more confidence. We couldn't help it with all the experience playing all
night long. It was handy them being foreign. We had to try even harder, put our heart and soul
into it, to get ourselves over.
In Liverpool, we'd only ever done one-hour sessions, and we just used to do our best numbers,
the same ones, at every one. In Hamburg, we had to play for eight hours, so we really had to
find a new way of playing.
Eight hours?
Here is Pete Best, the Beatles' drummer at the time: “Once the news got out about that we
were making a show, the club started packing them in. W e played seven nights a week. At first
we played almost nonstop till twelve-thirty, when it closed, but as we got better the crowds
stayed till two most mornings.”
Seven days a week?
The Beatles ended up traveling to Hamburg five times between i960 and the end of 1962. On
the first trip, they played 106 nights, five or more hours a night. On their second trip, they
played 92 times. On their third trip, they played 48 times, for a total of 172 hours on stage.
The last two Hamburg gigs, in November and December of 1962, involved another 90 hours of
performing. All told, they performed for 270 nights in just over a year and a half. By the time
they had their first burst of success in 1964, in fact, they had performed live an estimated twelve
Page 20/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
hundred times. Do you know how extraordinary that isMost bands today don't perform twelve
hundred times in their entire careers. The Hamburg crucible is one of the things that set the
Beatles apart.
“They were no good onstage when they went there and they were very good when they came
back,” Norman went on. “They learned not only stamina. They had to learn an enormous
amount of numberscover versions of everything you can think of, not just rock and roll, a bit of
jazz too. They weren't disciplined onstage at all before that. But when they came back, they
sounded like no one else. It was the making of them.”
Let's now turn to the history of Bill Gates. His story is almost as well known as the Beatles'.
Brilliant, young math whiz discovers computer programming. Drops out of Har vard. Starts a
little computer company called Microsoft with his friends. Through sheer brilliance and ambition
and guts builds it into the giant of the software world. That's the broad outline. Let's dig a little
bit deeper.
Gates's father was a wealthy lawyer in Seattle, and his mother was the daughter of a well-to-do
banker. As a child Bill was precocious and easily bored by his studies. So his parents took him
out of public school and, at the beginning of seventh grade, sent him to Lakeside, a private
school that catered to Seattle's elite families. Midway through Gates's second year at Lakeside,
the school started a computer club.
“The Mothers' Club at school did a rummage sale every year, and there was always the question
of what the money would go to,” Gates remembers. “Some went to the summer program,
where inner-city kids would come up to the campus. Some of it would go for teachers. That
year, they put three thousand dollars into a computer terminal down in this funny little room that
we subsequently took control of. It was kind of an amazing thing.”
It was an “amazing thing,” of course, because this was 1968. Most colleges didn't have
computer clubs in the 1960s. Even more remarkable was the kind of computer Lakeside
bought. The school didn't have its students learn programming by the laborious computer-card
system, like virtually everyone else was doing in the 1960s. Instead, Lakeside installed what was
called an ASR-33 Teletype, which was a time-sharing terminal with a direct link to a mainframe
computer in downtown Seattle. “The whole idea of time-sharing only got invented in nineteen
sixty five,” Gates continued. “Someone was pretty forwardlooking.” Bill Joy got an
extraordinary, early opportunity to learn programming on a time-share system as a fresh man in
college, in 1971. Bill Gates got to do real-time programming as an eighth grader in 1968.
From that moment forward, Gates lived in the computer room. He and a number of others
began to teach themselves how to use this strange new device. Buying time on the mainframe
computer the ASR was hooked up to was, of course, expensiveeven for a wealthy institution like
Lakesideand it wasn't long before the $3,000 put up by the Mothers' Club ran out. The parents
raised more money. The students spent it. Then a group of programmers at the University of
Washington formed an outfit called Computer Center Corporation (or C-Cubed), which leased
computer time to local companies. As luck would have it, one of the founders of the
firmMonique Ronahad a son at Lakeside, a year ahead of Gates. W ould the Lakeside computer
club, Rona wondered, like to test out the company's software programs on the weekends in
exchange for free programming time Absolutely! After school, Gates took the bus to the CPage 21/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Cubed offices and programmed long into the evening.
C-Cubed eventually went bankrupt, so Gates and his friends began hanging around the
computer center at the University of Washington. Before long, they latched onto an outfit called
ISI (Information Sciences Inc.), which agreed to let them have free computer time in exchange
for working on a piece of software that could be used to automate company payrolls. In one
seven-month period in 1971, Gates and his cohorts ran up 1,575 hours of computer time on
the ISI mainframe, which averages out to eight hours a day, seven days a week.
“It was my obsession,” Gates says of his early high school years. “I skipped athletics. I went up
there at night. We were programming on weekends. It would be a rare week that we wouldn't
get twenty or thirty hours in. There was a period where Paul Allen and I got in trouble for
stealing a bunch of passwords and crashing the system. We got kicked out. I didn't get to use the
computer the whole summer. This is when I was fifteen and sixteen. Then I found out Paul had
found a computer that was free at the University of Washington. They had these machines in
the medical center and the physics department. They were on a twenty-four-hour schedule, but
with this big slack period, so that between three and six in the morning they never scheduled
anything.“ Gates laughed. ”I'd leave at night, after my bedtime. I could walk up to the University
of Washington from my house. Or Fd take the bus. That's why I'm always so generous to the
University of W ashington, because they let me steal so much computer time.“ (Years later,
Gates's mother said, ”We always wondered why it was so hard for him to get up in the
morning.”)
One of the founders of ISI, Bud Pembroke, then got a call from the technology company TRW,
which had just signed a contract to set up a computer system at the huge Bonneville Power
station in southern Washington State. TRW desperately needed programmers familiar with the
particular software the power station used. In these early days of the computer revolution,
programmers with that kind of specialized experience were hard to find. But Pembroke knew
exactly whom to call: those high school kids from Lakeside who had been running up thousands
of hours of computer time on the ISI mainframe. Gates was now in his senior year, and
somehow he managed to convince his teachers to let him decamp for Bonneville under the
guise of an independent study project. There he spent the spring writing code, supervised by a
man named John Norton, who Gates says taught him as much about programming as almost
anyone he'd ever met.
Those five years, from eighth grade through the end of high school, were Bill Gates's Hamburg,
and by any measure, he was presented with an even more extraordinary series of opportunities
than Bill Joy.
Opportunity number one was that Gates got sent to Lakeside. How many high schools in the
world had access to a time-sharing terminal in 1968Opportunity number two was that the
mothers of Lakeside had enough money to pay for the school's computer fees. Number three
was that, when that money ran out, one of the parents happened to work at C-Cubed, which
happened to need someone to check its code on the weekends, and which also happened not
to care if weekends turned into weeknights. Number four was that Gates just happened to find
out about ISI, and ISI just happened to need someone to work on its payroll software. Number
five was that Gates happened to live within walking distance of the University of W ashington.
Number six was that the university happened to have free computer time between three and six
Page 22/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
in the morning. Number seven was that T R W happened to call Bud Pembroke. Number eight
was that the best programmers Pembroke knew for that particular problem happened to be two
high school kids. And number nine was that Lakeside was willing to let those kids spend their
spring term miles away, writing code.
A nd what did virtually all of those opportunities have in commonThey gave Bill Gates extra
time to practice. By the time Gates dropped out of Harvard after his sophomore year to try his
hand at his own software company,
he'd been programming practically nonstop for seven consecutive years. He was way past ten
thousand hours. How many teenagers in the world had the kind of experience Gates had“ I f
there were fifty in the world, I'd be stunned,” he says. “There was C-Cubed and the payroll stuff
we did, then TRWall those things came together. I had a better exposure to software
development at a young age than I think anyone did in that period of time, and all because of an
incredibly lucky series of events.”

If we put the stories of hockey players and the Beatles and Bill Joy and Bill Gates together, I
think we get a more complete picture of the path to success. Joy and Gates and the Beatles are
all undeniably talented. Lennon and McCartney had a musical gift of the sort that comes along
once in a generation, and Bill Joy, let us not forget, had a mind so quick that he was able to
make up a complicated algorithm on the fly that left his professors in awe. That much is obvious.
But what truly distinguishes their histories is not their extraordinary talent but their extraordinary
opportunities. The Beatles, for the most random of reasons, got invited to go to Hamburg.
Without Hamburg, the Beatles might well have taken a different path. “I was very lucky,” Bill
Gates said at the beginning of our interview. That doesn't mean he isn't brilliant or an
extraordinary entrepreneur. It just means that he understands what incredible good fortune it
was to be at Lakeside in 1968.
All the outliers we've looked at so far were the beneficiaries of some kind of unusual
opportunity. Lucky breaks don't seem like the exception with software billionaires and rock
bands and star athletes. They seem like the rule.
Let me give you one final example of the hidden opportunities that outliers benefit from.
Suppose we do another version of the calendar analysis we did in the previous chapter with
hockey players, only this time looking at birth years, not birth months. To start with, take a close
look at the following list of the seventy-five richest people in human history. The net worth of
each person is calculated in current US dollars. As you can see, it includes queens and kings and
pharaohs from centuries past, as well as contemporary billionaires, such as Warren Buffett and
Carlos Slim.
Do you know what's interesting about that list f the seventy-five names, an astonishing fourteen
are Americans born within nine years of one another in the midnineteenth century. Think about
that for a moment. Historians start with Cleopatra and the pharaohs and comb through every
year in human history every since, looking in every corner of the world for evidence of
extraordinary wealth, and almost 20 percent of the names they end up with come from a single
generation in a single country.

Peter Arrell Brown Widener, 1834 Philip Danforth Armour, 1832 Here's the list of those
Americans and their birth years:
What's going on hereThe answer becomes obvious if you think about it. In the 1860s and
1870s, the American economy went through perhaps the greatest transformation in its history.
This was when the railroads were being built and when Wall Street emerged. It was when
industrial manufacturing started in earnest. It was when all the rules by which the traditional
economy had functioned were broken and remade. What this list says is that it really matters
how old you were when that transformation happened.
If you were born in the late 1840s you missed it. You were too young to take advantage of that
moment. If you were born in the 1820s you were too old: your mind-set was shaped by the preCivil War paradigm. But there was a particular, narrow nine-year window that was just perfeet for seeing the potential that the future held. All of the fourteen men and women on the list
above had vision and talent. But they also were given an extraordinary opportu nity, in the same
way that hockey and soccer players born in January, February, and March are given an
extraordinary opportunity.'1"
Now let's do the same kind of analysis for people like Bill Joy and Bill Gates.
If you talk to veterans of Silicon Valley, they'll tell you that the most important date in the
history of the personal computer revolution was January 1975. That was when the magazine
Popular Electronics ran a cover story on an extraordinary machine called the Altair 8800. The
Altair cost $397. It was a do-it-yourself contraption that you could assemble at home. The
headline on the story read: “PROJECT BREAKTHROUGH! World's First Minicomputer Kit to
Rival Commercial Models.”
To the readers of Popular Electronics, in those days the bible of the fledgling software and
computer world, that headline was a revelation. Computers up to that point had * The
sociologist C . Wright Mills made an additional observation about that special cohort from the
1830s. He looked at the backgrounds of the American business elite from the Colonial Era to
the twentieth century. In most cases, not surprisingly, he found that business leaders tended to
come from privileged backgrounds. The one exceptionThe 1830s group. That shows how big
the advantage was of being born in that decade. It was the only time in American history when
those born in modest circumstances had a realistic shot at real riches. He writes: “The best time
during the history of the United States for the poor boy ambitious for high business success to
have been born was around the year 1835.”
been the massive, expensive mainframes of the sort sitting in the white expanse of the Michigan
Computer Center. For years, every hacker and electronics whiz had dreamt of the day when a
computer would come along that was small and inexpensive enough for an ordinary person to
use and own. That day had finally arrived.
Page 24/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
If January 1975 was the dawn of the personal computer age, then who would be in the best
position to take advantage of itThe same principles apply here that applied to the era of John
Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie.
“If you're too old in nineteen seventy-five, then you'd already have a job at IBM out of college,
and once people started at IBM, they had a real hard time making the transition to the new
world,” says Nathan Myhrvold, who was a top executive at Microsoft for many years. “You had
this multibillion-dollar company making mainframes, and if you were part of that, you'd think,
Why screw around with these little pathetic computersThat was the computer industry to those
people, and it had nothing to do with this new revolution. They were blinded by that being the
only vision of computing. They made a nice living. It's just that there was no opportunity to
become a zillionaire and make an impact on the world.”
If you were more than a few years out of college in 1975, then you belonged to the old
paradigm. You had just bought a house. You're married. A baby is on the way. You're in no
position to give up a good job and pension for some pie-in-the-sky $397 computer kit. So let's
rule out all those born before, say, 1952. At the same time, though, you don't want to be too
young. You really want to get in on the ground floor, right in 1975, and you can't do that if
you're still in high school. So let's also rule out anyone born after, say, 1958. The perfect age to
be in 1975, in other words, is old enough to be a part of the coming revolution but not so old
that you missed it. Ideally, you want to be twenty or twenty-one, which is to say, born in 1954
or 1955.
There is an easy way to test this theory. When was Bill Gates born?
Bill Gates: October 28,1955 That's the perfect birth date! Gates is the hockey player born on
January 1. Gates's best friend at Lakeside was Paul Allen. He also hung out in the computer
room with Gates and shared those long evenings at ISI and C-Cubed. Allen went on to found
Microsoft with Bill Gates. When was Paul Allen born?
Paul Allen: January 21, 1953 The third-richest man at Microsoft is the one who has been
running the company on a day-to-day basis since 2000, one of the most respected executives in
the software world, Steve Ballmer. Ballmer's birth date?
Steve Ballmer: March 24,1956 Let's not forget a man every bit as famous as Gates: Steve Jobs,
the cofounder of Apple Computer. Unlike Gates,
Jobs wasn't from a rich family and he didn't go to Michigan, like Joy. But it doesn't take much
investigation of his upbringing to realize that he had his Hamburg too. He grew up in Mountain
View, California, just south of San Francisco, which is the absolute epicenter of Silicon Valley.
His neighborhood was filled with engineers from Hewlett-Packard, then as now one of the most
important electronics firms in the world. As a teenager he prowled the flea markets of Mountain
View, where electronics hobbyists and tinkerers sold spare parts. Jobs came of age breathing
the air of the very business he would later dominate.
This paragraph horn Accidental Millionaire, one of the many Jobs biographies, gives us a sense
of how extraordinary his childhood experiences were. Jobs attended evening talks by HewlettPackard scientists. The talks were about the latest advances in electronics and Jobs, exercising a
Page 25/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
style that was a trademark of his personality, collared Hewlett-Packard engineers and drew
additional information from them. Once he even called Bill Hewlett, one of the company's
founders, to request parts. Jobs not only received the parts he asked for, he managed to
wrangle a summer job. Jobs worked on an assembly line to build computers and was so
fascinated that he tried to design his own...
Wait. Bill Hewlett gave him spare partsThat's on a par with Bill Gates getting unlimited access to
a time-share terminal at age thirteen. It's as if you were interested in fashion and your neighbor
when you were growing up happened to be Giorgio Armani. And when was Jobs born?
Steve Jobs: February 24, 1955 Another of the pioneers of the software revolution was Eric
Schmidt. He ran Novell, one of Silicon Valley's most important software firms, and in 2001, he
became the chief executive officer of Google. Birth date?
Eric Schmidt: April 27, 1955 I don't mean to suggest, of course, that every software tycoon in
Silicon Valley was born in 1955. Some weren't, just as not every business titan in the United
States was born in the mid-i830s. But there are very clearly patterns here, and what's striking is
how little we seem to want to acknowledge them. We pretend that success is exclusively a
matter of individual merit. But there's nothing in any of the histories we've looked at so far to
suggest things are that simple. These are stories, instead, about people who were given a
special opportunity to work really hard and seized it, and who happened to come of age at a
time when that extraordinary effort was rewarded by the rest of society. Their success was not
just of their own making. It was a product of the world in which they grew up.
By the way, let's not forget Bill Joy. Had he been just a little bit older and had he had to face
the drudgery of programming with computer cards, he says, he would have studied science. Bill
Joy the computer legend would have been Bill Joy the biologist. And had he come along a few
years later, the little window that gave him the chance to write the supporting code for the
Internet would have closed. Again, Bill Joy the computer legend might well have been Bill Joy
the biologist. When was Bill Joy born?
Bill Joy: November 8, 1954 Joy would go on, after his stint at Berkeley, to become one of the
four founders of Sun Microsystems, one of the oldest and most important of Silicon Valley's
software compa nies. And if you still think that accidents of time and place and birth don't
matter all that much, here are the birthdays of the three other founders of Sun Microsystems:
Scott McNealy: November 13,1954 Vinod Khosla: January 28,1955 Andy Bechtolsheim:
September 30, 1955

CHAPTER THREE
The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 1 “KNOWLEDGE OF A BOY'S IQ IS OF LITTLE HELP IF
YOU ARE FACED WITH A FORMFUL OF CLEVER BOYS.”
1.
In the fifth episode of the 2008 season, the American television quiz show / vs. 100 had as its
special guest a man named Christopher Langan.
The television show 1 vs. 100 is one of many that sprang up in the wake of the phenomenal
success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. It features a permanent gallery of one hundred
ordinary people who serve as what is called the “mob.” Each week they match wits with a
special invited guest. At stake is a million dollars. The guest has to be smart enough to answer
more questions correctly than his or her one hundred adversariesand by that standard, few have
ever seemed as superbly qualified as Christopher Langan.
“Tonight the mob takes on their fiercest competition yet,” the voice-over began. “Meet Chris
Langan, who many call the smartest man in America.“ The camera did a slow pan of a stocky,
muscular man in his fifties. ”The average person has an IQ of one hundred,“ the voice-over
continued. ”Einstein one fifty. Chris has an IQ of one ninety-five. He's currently wrapping his
big brain around a theory of the universe. But will his king-size cranium be enough to take down
the mob for one million dollarsFind out right now on One versus One Hundred”
Out strode Langan onto the stage amid wild applause.
“You don't think you need to have a high intellect to do well on One versus One Hundred, do
you?” the show's host, Bob Saget, asked him. Saget looked at Langan oddly, as if he were some
kind of laboratory specimen.
“Actually, I think it could be a hindrance,” Langan replied. He had a deep, certain voice. “To
have a high IQ, you tend to specialize, think deep thoughts. You avoid trivia. But now that I see
these people”he glanced at the mob, the amusement in his eyes betraying just how ridiculous he
found the proceedings “I think I'll do okay.”
Over the past decade, Chris Langan has achieved a strange kind of fame. He has become the
public face of genius in American life, a celebrity outlier. He gets invited on news shows and
profiled in magazines, and he has been the subject of a documentary by the filmmaker Errol
Morris, all because of a brain that appears to defy description.
The television news show 20/20 once hired a neuropsychologist to give Langan an IQ test, and
Langan's score was literally off the chartstoo high to be accurately measured. Another time,
Langan took an IQ test specially designed for people too smart for ordinary IQ tests. He got all
the questions right except one.“” He was speaking at six months of age. When he was three, he
would listen to the radio on Sundays as the announcer read the comics aloud, and he would
follow along on his own until he had taught himself to read. At five, he began questioning his
Page 27/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
grandfather about the existence of Godand remembers being disappointed in the answers he
got.
In school, Langan could walk into a test in a foreignlanguage class, not having studied at all, and
if there were two or three minutes before the instructor arrived, he could skim through the
textbook and ace the test. In his early teenage years, while working as a farmhand, he started to
read widely in the area of theoretical physics. A t sixteen, he made his way through Bertrand
Russell and Alfred North Whitehead's famously abstruse masterpiece Principia Mathematica. H
e got a perfect score on his SA T, even though he fell asleep at one point during the test.
“He did math for an hour,” his brother Mark says of Langan's summer routine in high school.
“Then he did French for an hour. Then he studied Russian. Then he would read philosophy. He
did that religiously, every day.”
Another of his brothers, Jeff, says, "You know, when Christopher was fourteen or fifteen, he
would draw things just as a joke, and it would be like a photograph. When he was fifteen, he
could match Jimi Hendrix lick for lick on a guitar. Boom. Boom. Boom. Half the time,
Christopher didn't attend school at all. He would just show up for tests * The super IQ test was
created by Ronald K. Hoeflin, who is himself someone with an unusually high IQ. Here's a
sample question, from the verbal analogies section. “Teeth is to Hen as Nest is to ?” If you want
to know the answer, I'm afraid I have no idea.
and there was nothing they could do about it. To us, it was hilarious. He could brief a semester's
worth of textbooks in two days, and take care of whatever he had to take care of, and then get
back to whatever he was doing in the first place."*
On the set of / vs. zoo, Langan was poised and confident. His voice was deep. His eyes were
small and fiercely bright. He did not circle about topics, searching for the right phrase, or double
back to restate a previous sentence.
* To get a sense of what Chris Langan must have been like growing up, consider the following
description of a child named “L,” who had an IQ in the same 200 range as Langan's. It's from a
study by Leta Stetter Hollingworth, who was one of the first psychologists to study exceptionally
gifted children. As the description makes obvious, an IQ of 200 is really, really high: "Young L's
erudition was astonishing. His passion for scholarly accuracy and thoroughness set a high
standard for accomplishment. H e was relatively large, robust and impressive, and was fondly
dubbed 'Professor.' His attitudes and abilities were appreciated by both pupils and teachers. He
was often allowed to lecture (for as long as an hour) on some special topic, such as the history of
timepieces, ancient theories of engine construction, mathematics, and history. He constructed
out of odds and ends (typewriter ribbon spools, for example) a homemade clock of the pendular
type to illustrate some of the principles of chronometry, and this clock was set up before the
class during the enrichment unit on 'Time and Time Keeping' to demonstrate some of the
principles of chronometry. His notebooks were marvels of scholarly exposition.
“Being discontented with what he considered the inadequate treatment of land travel in a class
unit on 'Transportation,' he agreed that time was too limited to do justice to everything. But he
insisted that 'at least they should have covered ancient theory.' A s an extra and voluntary
project, 'he brought in elaborate drawings and accounts of the ancient theories of engines,
Page 28/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
locomotives etc'... He was at that time 10 years of age.”
For that matter, he did not say um, or ah, or use any form of conversational mitigation: his
sentences came marching out, one after another, polished and crisp, like soldiers on a parade
ground. Every question Saget threw at him, he tossed aside, as if it were a triviality. When his
winnings reached $250,000, he appeared to make a mental calculation that the risks of losing
everything were at that point greater than the potential benefits of staying in. Abruptly, he
stopped. "I'll take the cash/' he said. He shook Saget's hand firmly and was finishedexiting on
top as, we like to think, geniuses invariably do.
2.
Just after the First World War, Lewis Terman, a young professor of psychology at Stanford
University, met a remarkable boy named Henry Cowell. Cowell had been raised in poverty and
chaos. Because he did not get along with other children, he had been unschooled since the age
of seven. He worked as a janitor at a one-room schoolhouse not far from the Stanford campus,
and throughout the day, Cowell would sneak away from his job and play the school piano. And
the music he made was beautiful.
Terman's specialty was intelligence testing; the standard IQ test that millions of people around
the world would take during the following fifty years, the StanfordBinet, was his creation. So he
decided to test CowelPs IQ. The boy must be intelligent, he reasoned, and sure enough, he was.
He had an IQ of above 140, which is near genius level. Terman was fascinated. How many
other diamonds in the rough were therehe wondered.
He began to look for others. He found a girl who knew the alphabet at nineteen months, and
another who was reading Dickens and Shakespeare by the time she was four. He found a young
man who had been kicked out of law school because his professors did not believe that it was
possible for a human being to precisely reproduce long passages of legal opinions from
memory.
In 1921, Terman decided to make the study of the gifted his life work. Armed with a large grant
from the Commonwealth Foundation, he put together a team of fieldworkers and sent them out
into California's elementary schools. Teachers were asked to nominate the brightest students in
their classes. Those children were given an intelligence test. The students who scored in the top
10 percent were then given a second IQ test, and those who scored above 130 on that test
were given a third IQ test, and from that set of results Terman selected the best and the
brightest. By the time Terman was finished, he had sorted through the records of some
250,000 elementary and high school students, and identified 1,470 children whose IQs
averaged over 140 and ranged as high as 200. That group of young geniuses came to be known
as the “Termites,” and they were the subjects of what would become one of the most famous
psychological studies in history.
For the rest of his life, Terman watched over his charges like a mother hen. They were tracked
and tested, measured and analyzed. Their educational attainments were noted, marriages
followed, illnesses tabulated, psychological health charted, and every promotion and job change
dutifully recorded. Terman wrote his recruits letters of recommendation for jobs and graduate school applications. He doled out a constant stream of advice and
Page 29/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
counsel, all the time recording his findings in thick red volumes entitled Genetic Studies of
Genius.
“There is nothing about an individual as important as his IQ, except possibly his morals,”
Terman once said. And it was to those with a very high IQ, he believed, that “we must look for
production of leaders who advance science, art, government, education and social welfare
generally.” As his subjects grew older, Terman issued updates on their progress, chronicling
their extraordinary achievements. “It is almost impossible,” Terman wrote giddily, when his
charges were in high school, “to read a newspaper account of any sort of competition or activity
in which California boys and girls participate without finding among the winners the names of
one or more...members of our gifted group.” He took writing samples from some of his most
artistically minded subjects and had literary critics compare them to the early writings of famous
authors. They could find no difference. All the signs pointed, he said, to a group with the
potential for “heroic stature.” Terman believed that his Termites were destined to be the future
elite of the United States.
Today, many of Terman's ideas remain central to the way we think about success. Schools have
programs for the “gifted.” Elite universities often require that students take an intelligence test
(such as the American Scholastic Aptitude Test) for admission. High-tech companies like Google
or Microsoft carefully measure the cognitive abilities of prospective employees out of the same
belief: they are convinced that those at the very top of the IQ scale have the greatest potential.
(At Microsoft, famously, job applicants are asked a battery of questions designed to test their
smarts, including the classic “Why are manhole covers round?” If you don't know the answer to
that question, you're not smart enough to work at Microsoft.*)
If I had magical powers and offered to raise your IQ by 30 points, you'd say yesrightYou'd
assume that would help you get further ahead in the world. And when we hear about someone
like Chris Langan, our instinctive response is the same as Terman's instinctive response when
he met Henry Cowell almost a century ago. We feel awe. Geniuses are the ultimate outliers.
Surely there is nothing that can hold someone like that back.
But is that true?
So far in Outliers, we've seen that extraordinary achievement is less about talent than it is about
opportu nity. In this chapter, I want to try to dig deeper into why that's the case by looking at
the outlier in its purest and most distilled formthe genius. For years, we've taken our cues from
people like Terman when it comes to understanding the significance of high intelligence. But, as
we shall see, Terman made an error. He was wrong about his Termites, and had he happened
on the young Chris Langan working his way through Principia Mathematica at the age of
sixteen, he would have been wrong about him * The answer is that a round manhole cover can't
fall into the manhole, no matter how much you twist and turn it. A rectangular cover can: All
you have to do is tilt it sideways. There: now you can get a job at Microsoft.
for the same reason. Terman didn't understand what a real outlier was, and that's a mistake we
continue to make to this day.
3.
One of the most widely used intelligence tests is something called Raven's Progressive Matrices.
Page 30/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
It requires no language skills or specifie body of acquired knowledge. It's a measure of abstract
reasoning skills. A typical Raven's test consists of forty-eight items, each one harder than the
one before it, and IQ is calculated based on how many items are answered correctly.
Here's a question, typical of the sort that is asked on the Raven's.
Did you get thatI'm guessing most of you did. The correct answer is C. But now try this one. It's
the kind of really hard question that comes at the end of the Raven's.
The correct answer is A. I have to confess I couldn't figure this one out, and I'm guessing most
of you couldn't either. Chris Langan almost certainly could, however. When we say that people
like Langan are really brilliant, what we mean is that they have the kind of mind that can figure
out puzzles like that last question.
Over the years, an enormous amount of research has been done in an attempt to determine
how a person's performance on an IQ test like the Raven's translates to reallife success. People
at the bottom of the scalewith an IQ below 70are considered mentally disabled. A score of ioo is
average; you probably need to be just above that mark to be able to handle college. To get into
and succeed in a reasonably competitive graduate program, meanwhile, you probably need an
IQ of at least 115. In general, the higher your score, the more education you'll get, the more
money you're likely to make, andbelieve it or notthe longer you'll live.
But there's a catch. The relationship between success and IQ works only up to a point. Once
someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120, having additional IQ points doesn't
seem to translate into any measurable real-world advantage.*
“It is amply proved that someone with an IQ of 170 is more likely to think well than someone
whose IQ is 70,” the * The “IQ fundamentalist” Arthur Jensen put it thusly in his 1980 book
Bias in Mental Testing (p. 113): “The four socially and personally most important threshold
regions on the I Q scale are those that differentiate with high probability between persons who,
because of their level of general mental ability, can or cannot attend a regular school (about IQ
50), can or cannot master the traditional subject matter of elementary school (about IQ 75),can
or cannot succeed in the academic or college preparatory curriculum through high school (about
IQ 105), can or cannot graduate from an accredited four-year college with grades that would
qualify for admission to a professional or graduate school (about IQ 115). Beyond this, the IQ
level becomes relatively unimportant in terms of ordinary occupational aspirations and criteria of
success. That is not to say that there are not real differences between the intellectual capabilities
represented by IQs of 115 and 150 or even between IQs of 150 and 180. But IQ differences in
this upper part of the scale have far less personal implications than the thresholds just described
and are generally of lesser importance for success in the popular sense than are certain traits of
personality and character.”
British psychologist Liam Hudson has written, “and this holds true where the comparison is
much closerbetween IQs of, say, 100 and 130.But the relation seems to break down when one
is making comparisons between two people both of whom have IQs which are relatively
high....A mature scientist with an adult IQ of 130 is as likely to win a Nobel Prize as is one
whose IQ is 180.”
What Hudson is saying is that IQ is a lot like height in basketball. Does someone who is five foot
Page 31/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
six have a realistic chance of playing professional basketballNot really. You need to be at least
six foot or six one to play at that level, and, all things being equal, it's probably better to be six
two than six one, and better to be six three than six two. But past a certain point, height stops
mattering so much. A player who is six foot eight is not automatically better than someone two
inches shorter. (Michael Jordan, the greatest player ever, was six six after all.) A basketball
player only has to be tall enoughand the same is true of intelligence. Intelligence has a
threshold.
The introduction to the / vs. 100 episode pointed out that Einstein had an IQ of 150 and
Langan has an IQ of 195.Langan's IQ is 30percent higher than Einstein's. But that doesn't
mean Langan is 30percent smarter than Einstein. That's ridiculous. All we can say is that when
it comes to thinking about really hard things like physics, they are both clearly smart enough.
The idea that I Q has a threshold, I realize, goes against our intuition. We think that, say, Nobel
Prize winners in science must have the highest IQ scores imaginable; that they must be the kinds
of people who got perfect scores on their entrance examinations to college, won every scholarship available, and had such stellar academic records in high school that they were scooped up
by the top universities in the country.
But take a look at the following list of where the last twenty-five Americans to win the Nobel
Prize in Medicine got their undergraduate degrees, starting in 2007.
Antioch College Brown University UC Berkeley University of Washington Columbia University
Case Institute of Technology MIT Caltech Harvard University Hamilton College Columbia
University University of North Carolina DePauw University University of Pennsylvania University
of Minnesota University of Notre Dame Johns Hopkins University Yale University Union
College, Kentucky University of Illinois University of Texas Holy Cross Amherst College
Gettysburg College Hunter College N o one would say that this list represents the college
choices of the absolute best high school students in America. Yale and Columbia and MIT are
on the list, but so are DePauw, Holy Cross, and Gettysburg College. It's a list of good schools.
A long the same lines, here are the colleges of the last twenty-five American Nobel laureates in
Chemistry:
City College ofNew York City College ofNew York Stanford University University of Dayton,
Ohio Rollins College, Florida MIT Grinnell College MIT McGill University Georgia Institute of
Technology Ohio Wesleyan University Rice University Hope College Brigham Young University
University of Toronto University ofNebraska Dartmouth College Harvard University Berea
College Augsburg College University of Massachusetts Washington State University University of
Florida University of California, Riverside Harvard University To be a Nobel Prize winner,
apparently, you have to be smart enough to get into a college at least as good as Notre Dame or
the University of Illinois. That's all.*
This is a radical idea, isn't itSuppose that your teenage daughter found out that she had been
accepted at two universities Harvard University and Georgetown University, in Washington, DC.
Where would you want her to goI'm guessing Harvard, because Harvard is a “better” school. Its
students score a good 10 to 15 percent higher on their entrance exams.
Page 32/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
But given what we are learning about intelligence, the idea that schools can be ranked, like
runners in a race, makes no sense. Georgetown's students may not be as smart on an absolute
scale as the students of Harvard. But they are all, clearly, smart enough, and future Nobel Prize
winners come from schools like Georgetown as well as from schools like Harvard.
The psychologist Barry Schwartz recently proposed that elite schools give up their complex
admissions process and simply hold a lottery for everyone above the * Just to be clear: it is still
the case that Harvard produces more Nobel Prize winners than any other school. Just look at
those lists. Harvard appears on both of them, a total of three times. A school like Holy Cross
appears just once. But wouldn't you expect schools like Harvard to win more Nobels than they
doHarvard is, after all, the richest, most prestigious school in history and has its pick of the most
brilliant undergraduates the world over.
threshold. “Put people into two categories,” Schwartz says. “Good enough and not good
enough. The ones who are good enough get put into a hat. And those who are not good
enough get rejected.” Schwartz concedes that his idea has virtually n o chance o f being
accepted. But he's absolutely right. A s Hudson writes (and keep in mind that he did his
research at elite all-male English boarding schools in the 1950s and 1960s), “Knowledge of a
boy's IQ is of little help if you are faced with aformful of clever boys.”''
Let me give you an example of the threshold effect in action. The University of Michigan law
school, like many elite US educational institutions, uses a policy of affirmative action when it
comes to applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. Around 10 percent of the students
Michigan enrolls each fall are members of racial minorities, and if the law school did not
significantly relax its entry requirements for those studentsadmitting them with lower
undergraduate grades and lower standardized-test scores than everyone elseit estimates that
percentage would be less than 3 percent. Furthermore, if we compare the grades that the
minority and nonminority students get in * To get a sense of how absurd the selection process at
elite Ivy League schools has become, consider the following statistics. In 2 0 0 8 , 2 7 , 4 6 2 of
the most highly qualified high school seniors in the world applied to Harvard University. Of
these students, 2,500 of them scored a perfect 800 on the SAT critical reading test and 3,300
had aperfect score on the SAT math exam. More than 3,300 were rankedfirstin their high
school class. How many did Harvard acceptAbout 1,600, which is to say they rejected 93 out of
every 100 applicants. Is it really possible to say that one student is Harvard material and another
isn't, when both have identicaland perfectacademic recordsOf course not. Harvard is being
dishonest. Schwartz is right. They should just have a lottery.
law school, we see that the white students do better. That's not surprising: if one group has
higher undergraduate grades and test scores than the other, it's almost certainly going to have
higher grades in law school as well. This is one reason that affirmative action programs are so
controversial. In fact, an attack on the University of Michigan's affirmative action program
recently went all the way to the US Supreme Court. For many people it is troubling that an elite
educational institution lets in students who are less qualified than their peers.
A few years ago, however, the University of Michigan decided to look closely at how the law
school's minority students had fared after they graduated. How much money did they makeHow
far up in the profession did they goHow satisfied were they with their careersWhat kind of social
and community contributions did they makeWhat kind of honors had they wonThey looked at
Page 33/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
everything that could conceivably be an indication of real-world success. And what they found
surprised them.
“We knew that our minority students, a lot of them, were doing well,” says Richard Lempert,
one of the authors of the Michigan study. “I think our expectation was that we would find a
halfor two-thirds-full glass, that they had not done as well as the white students but nonetheless a
lot were quite successful. But we were completely surprised. We found that they were doing
every bit as well. There was no place we saw any serious discrepancy.”
What Lempert is saying is that by the only measure that a law school really ought to care
abouthow well its graduates do in the real worldminority students aren't less qualified. They're
just as successful as white students.
And whyBecause even though the academic credentials of minority students at Michigan aren't
as good as those of white students, the quality of students at the law school is high enough that
they're still above the threshold. They are smart enough. Knowledge of a law student's test
scores is of little help if you are faced with a classroom of clever law students.
4.
Let's take the threshold idea one step further. If intelligence matters only up to a point, then
past that point, other thingsthings that have nothing to do with intelligencemust start to matter
more. It's like basketball again: once someone is tall enough, then we start to care about speed
and court sense and agility and ballhandling skills and shooting touch.
So, what might some of those other things beWell, suppose that instead of measuring your IQ, I
gave you a totally different kind of test.
Write down as many different uses that you can think of for the following objects:
1. a brick 2. a blanket This is an example of what's called a “divergence test” (as opposed to a
test like the Raven's, which asks you to sort through a list of possibilities and converge on the
right answer). It requires you to use your imagination and take your mind in as many different
directions as possible. With a divergence test, obviously there isn't a single right answer. What
the test giver is looking for are the number and the uniqueness of your responses. And what the
test is measuring isn't analytical intelligence but something profoundly differentsomething much
closer to creativity. Divergence tests are every bit as challenging as convergence tests, and if you
don't believe that, I encourage you to pause and try the brick-and-blanket test right now.
Here, for example, are answers to the “uses of objects” test collected by Liam Hudson from a
student named Poole at a top British high school:
(Brick). To use in smash-and-grab raids. To help hold a house together. To use in a game of
Russian roulette if you want to keep fit at the same time (bricks at ten paces, turn and throwno
evasive action allowed). To hold the eiderdown on a bed tie a brick at each corner. As a breaker
of empty Coca-Cola bottles.
(Blanket). To use on a bed. As a cover for illicit sex in the woods. As a tent. To make smoke
signals with. As a sail for a boat, cart or sled. As a substitute for a towel. As a target for shooting
practice for short-sighted people. As a thing to catch people jumping out of burning skyscrapers.
Page 34/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
It's not hard to read Poole's answers and get some sense of how his mind works. He's funny.
He's a little subversive and libidinous. He has the flair for the dramatic. His mind leaps from
violent imagery to sex to people jumping out of burning skyscrapers to very practical issues,
such as how to get a duvet to stay on a bed. He gives us the impression that if we gave him
another ten minutes, he'd come up with another twenty uses.*
Now, for the sake of comparison, consider the answers of another student from Hudson's
sample. His name is Florence. Hudson tells us that Florence is a prodigy, with one of the
highest IQs in his school.
(Brick). Building things, throwing.
(Blanket). Keeping warm, smothering fire, tying to trees and sleeping in (as a hammock),
improvised stretcher.
Where is Florence's imaginationHe identified the most common and most functional uses for
bricks and blankets and simply stopped. Florence's IQ is higher than Poole's. But that means
little, since both students are above the threshold. What is more interesting is that Poole's mind
can leap from violent imagery to sex to people jumping out of buildings without missing a beat,
and Florence's mind can't. Now which of these two students do you think is better suited to do
the kind of brilliant, imaginative work that wins Nobel Prizes?
* Here's another student's answers. These might be even better than Poole's: “(Brick). To break
windows for robbery, to determine depth of wells, to use as ammunition, as pendulum, to
practice carving, wall building, to demonstrate Archimedes' Principle, as part of abstract
sculpture, costh, ballast, weight for dropping things in river, etc., as a hammer, keep door open,
footwiper, use as rubble for path filling, chock, weight on scale, to prop up wobbly table,
paperweight, as firehearth, to block up rabbit hole.”
That's the second reason Nobel Prize winners come from Holy Cross as well as Harvard,
because Harvard isn't selecting its students on the basis of how well they do on the “uses of a
brick” testand maybe “uses of a brick” is a better predictor of Nobel Prize ability. It's also the
second reason Michigan Law School couldn't find a difference between its affirmative action
graduates and the rest of its alumni. Being a successful lawyer is about a lot more than IQ. It
involves having the kind of fertile mind that Poole had. And just because Michigan's minority
students have lower scores on convergence tests doesn't mean they don't have that other
critical trait in abundance.
5.
This was Terman's error. He fell in love with the fact that his Termites were at the absolute
pinnacle of the intellectual scaleat the ninety-ninth percentile of the ninety-ninth
percentilewithout realizing how little that seemingly extraordinary fact meant.
By the time the Termites reached adulthood, Terman's error was plain to see. Some of his child
geniuses had grown up to publish books and scholarly articles and thrive in busi ness. Several
ran for public office, and there were two superior court justices, one municipal court judge, two
members of the California state legislature, and one prominent state official. But few of his
Page 35/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
geniuses were nationally known figures. They tended to earn good incomesbut not that good.
The majority had careers that could only be considered ordinary, and a surprising number ended
up with careers that even Terman considered failures. Nor were there any Nobel Prize winners
in his exhaustively selected group of geniuses. His fieldworkers actually tested two elementary
students who went on to be Nobel laureatesWilliam Shockley and Luis Alvarezand rejected them
both. Their IQs weren't high enough.
In a devastating critique, the sociologist Pitirim Sorokin once showed that if Terman had simply
put together a randomly selected group of children from the same kinds of family backgrounds
as the Termitesand dispensed with IQs altogetherhe would have ended up with a group doing
almost as many impressive things as his painstakingly selected group of geniuses. “By no stretch
of the imagination or of standards of genius,” Sorokin con cluded, “is the 'gifted group' as a
whole 'gifted.' ” By the time Terman came out with his fourth volume of Genetic Studies of
Genius, the word “genius” had all but vanished. “We have seen,” Terman concluded, with more
than a touch of disappointment, “that intellect and achievement are far from perfectly
correlated.”
What I told you at the beginning of this chapter about the extraordinary intelligence of Chris
Langan, in other words, is of little use if we want to understand his chances of being a success in
the world. Yes,he is a man with a one-in-a-million mind and the ability to get through Principia
Mathematica at sixteen. And yes, his sentences come marching out one after another, polished
and crisp like soldiers on a parade ground. But so what, if we want to understand the likelihood
of his becoming a true outlier, we have to know a lot more about him than that.

CHAPTER FOUR
The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 2 “AFTER PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS, IT WAS
AGREED THAT ROBERT WOULD BE PUT ON PROBATION.”
1.
Chris Langan's mother was from San Francisco and was estranged from her family. She had
four sons, each with a different father. Chris was the eldest. His father disappeared before Chris
was born; he was said to have died in Mexico. His mother's second husband was murdered. Her
third committed suicide. Her fourth was a failed journalist named Jack Langan.
“To this day I haven't met anybody who was as poor when they were kids as our family was,”
Chris Langan says. “We didn't have a pair of matched socks. Our shoes had holes in them. Our
pants had holes in them. We only had one set of clothes. I remember my brothers and I going
into the bathroom and using the bathtub to wash our only set of clothes and we were bare-assed
naked when we were doing that because we didn't have anything to wear.”
Jack Langan would go on drinking sprees and disappear.
He would lock the kitchen cabinets so the boys couldn't get to the food. He used a bullwhip to
keep the boys in line. He would get jobs and then lose them, moving the family on to the next
town. One summer the family lived on an Indian reservation in a teepee, subsisting on
governmentsurplus peanut butter and cornmeal. For a time, they lived in Virginia City, Nevada.
“There was only one law officer in town, and when the Hell's Angels came to town, he would
crouch down in the back of his office,” Mark Langan remembers. “There was a bar there, I'll
always remember. It was called the Bucket of Blood Saloon.”
When the boys were in grade school, the family moved to Bozeman, Montana. One of Chris's
brothers spent time in a foster home. A nother was sent to reform school.
“I don't think the school ever understood just how gifted Christopher was,” his brother Jeff says.
“He sure as hell didn't play it up. This was Bozeman. It wasn't like it is today. It was a small hick
town when we were growing up. We weren't treated well there. They'd just decided that my
family was a bunch of deadbeats.” T o stick up for himself and his brothers, Chris started to lift
weights. One day, when Chris was fourteen, Jack Langan got rough with the boys, as he
sometimes did, and Chris knocked him out cold. Jack left, never to return. Upon graduation
from high school, Chris was offered two full scholarships, one to Reed College in Oregon and
the other to the University of Chicago. He chose Reed.
“It was a huge mistake,” Chris recalls. “I had a real case of culture shock. I was a crew-cut kid
who had been working as a ranch hand in the summers in Montana, and there I was, with a
whole bunch of long-haired city kids, most of them from New York. And these kids had a whole
different style than I was used to. I couldn't get a word in edgewise at class. They were very
inquisitive. Asking questions all the time. I was crammed into a dorm room. There were four of
us, and the other three guys had a whole different other lifestyle. They were smoking pot. They
Page 37/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
would bring their girlfriends into the room. I had never smoked pot before. So basically I took to
hiding in the library.”
He continued: “Then I lost that scholarship My mother was supposed to fill out a parents'
financial statement for the renewal of that scholarship. She neglected to do so. She was
confused by the requirements or whatever. At some point, it came to my attention that my
scholarship had not been renewed. So I went to the office to ask why, and they told me, Well,
no one sent us the financial statement, and we allocated all the scholarship money and it's all
gone, so I'm afraid that you don't have a scholarship here anymore. That was the style of the
place. They simply didn't care. They didn't give a shit about their students. There was no
counseling, no mentoring, nothing.”
Chris left Reed before the final set of exams, leaving him with a row of Fs on his transcript. In
the first semester, he had earned As. He went back to Bozeman and worked in construction and
as a forest services firefighter for a year and a half. Then he enrolled at Montana State
University.
“I was taking math and philosophy classes,” he recalled. “And then in the winter quarter, I was
living thirteen miles out of town, out on Beach Hill Road, and the transmission fell out of my car.
My brothers had used it when I was gone that summer. They were working for the railroad and
had driven it on the railroad tracks. I didn't have the money to repair it. So I went to my adviser
and the dean in sequence and said, I have a problem. The transmission fell out of my car, and
you have me in a seven-thirty a.m. and eight-thirty a.m. class. If you could please just transfer
me to the afternoon sections of these classes, I would appreciate it because of this car problem.
There was a neighbor who was a rancher who was going to take me in at eleven o'clock. My
adviser was this cowboy-looking guy with a handlebar mustache, dressed in a tweed jacket. He
said, 'Well, son, after looking at your transcript at Reed College, I see that you have yet to learn
that everyone has to make sacrifices to get an education. Request denied.' So then I went to the
dean. Same treatment.”
His voice grew tight. He was describing things that had happened more than thirty years ago,
but the memory still made him angry. “At that point I realized, here I was, knocking myself out
to make the money to make my way back to school, and it's the middle of the Montana winter. I
am willing to hitchhike into town every day, do whatever I had to do, just to get into school and
back, and they are unwilling to do anything for me. So bananas. And that was the point I
decided I could do without the higher-education system. Even if I couldn't do without it, it was
sufficiently repugnant to me that I wouldn't do it anymore. So I dropped out of college, simple
as that.”
Chris Langan's experiences at Reed and Montana State represented a turning point in his life.
As a child, he had dreamt of becoming an academic. He should have gotten a PhD; universities
are institutions structured, in large part,
for people with his kind of deep intellectual interests and curiosity. “Once he got into the
university environment, I thought he would prosper, I really did/' his brother Mark says. ”I
thought he would somehow find a niche. It made absolutely no sense to me when he left that."
Without a degree, Langan floundered. He worked in construction. One frigid winter he worked
Page 38/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
on a clam boat on Long Island. He took factory jobs and minor civil service positions and
eventually became a bouncer in a bar on Long Island, which was his principal occupation for
much of his adult years. Through it all, he continued to read deeply in philosophy, mathematics,
and physics as he worked on a sprawling treatise he calls the “ C T M U ” t h e “Cognitive
Theoretic Model of the Universe.” But without academic credentials, he despairs of ever getting
published in a scholarly journal.
“I am a guy who has a year and a half of college,” he says, with a shrug. “And at some point this
will come to the attention of the editor, as he is going to take the paper and send it off to the
referees, and these referees are going to try and look me up, and they are not going to find me.
And they are going to say, This guy has a year and a half of college. How can he know what
he's talking about?”
It is a heartbreaking story. At one point I asked Langan hypotheticallywhether he would take a
job at Harvard University were it offered to him. “Well, that's a difficult question,” he replied.
"Obviously, as a full professor at Harvard I would count. My ideas would have weight and I could
use my position, my affiliation at Harvard, to promote my ideas. A n institution like that is a
great source of intellectual energy, and if I were at a place like that, I could absorb the vibration
in the air.“ It was suddenly clear how lonely his life has been. Here he was, a man with an
insatiable appetite for learning, forced for most of his adult life to live in intellectual isolation. ”I
even noticed that kind of intellectual energy in the year and a half I was in college,“ he said,
almost wistfully. ”Ideas are in the air constantly. It's such a stimulating place to be.
“On the other hand,” he went on, “Harvard is basically a glorified corporation, operating with a
profit incentive. That's what makes it tick. It has an endowment in the billions of dollars. The
people running it are not necessarily searching for truth and knowledge. They want to be big
shots, and when you accept a paycheck from these people, it is going to come down to what
you want to do and what you feel is right versus what the man says you can do to receive
another paycheck. When you're there, they got a thumb right on you. They are out to make
sure you don't step out of line.”
2.
What does the story of Chris Langan tell usHis explanations, as heartbreaking as they are, are
also a little strange. His mother forgets to sign his financial aid form andjust like thatno
scholarship. He tries to move from a morning to an afternoon class, something students do
every day, and gets stopped cold. And why were Langan's teachers at Reed and Montana State
so indifferent to his plightTeachers typically delight in minds as brilliant as his. Langan talks
about dealing with Reed and Montana State as if they were some kind of vast and unyielding
govern ment bureaucracy. But colleges, particularly small liberal arts colleges like Reed, tend not
to be rigid bureaucracies. Making allowances in the name of helping someone stay in school is
what professors do all the time.
Even in his discussion of Harvard, it's as if Langan has no conception of the culture and
particulars of the institution he's talking about. When you accept a paycheck from these people,
it is going to come down to what you want to do and what you feel is right versus what the man
says you can do to receive another paycheck. WhatOne of the main reasons college professors
accept a lower paycheck than they could get in private industry is that university life gives them
Page 39/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
the freedom to do what they want to do and what they feel is right. Langan has Harvard
backwards.
When Langan told me his life story, I couldn't help thinking of the life of Robert Oppenheimer,
the physicist who famously headed the American effort to develop the nuclear bomb during
World War II. Oppenheimer, by all accounts, was a child with a mind very much like Chris
Langan's. His parents considered him a genius. One of his teachers recalled that “he received
every new idea as perfectly beautiful.” He was doing lab experiments by the third grade and
studying physics and chemistry by the fifth grade. When he was nine, he once told one of his
cousins, “Ask me a question in Latin and I will answer you in Greek.”
Oppenheimer went to Harvard and then on to Cambridge University to pursue a doctorate in
physics. There, Oppenheimer, who struggled with depression his entire life, grew despondent.
His gift was for theoretical physics, and his tutor, a man named Patrick Blackett (who would win
a Nobel Prize in 1948), was forcing him to attend to the minutiae of experimental physics,
which he hated. He grew more and more emotionally unstable, and then, in an act so strange
that to this day no one has properly made sense of it, Oppenheimer took some chemicals from
the laboratory and tried to poison his tutor.
Blackett, luckily, found out that something was amiss. The university was informed.
Oppenheimer was called on the carpet. And what happened next is every bit as unbe lievable as
the crime itself. Here is how the incident is described in American Prometheus, Kai Bird and
Martin Sherwin's biography of Oppenheimer: “After protracted negotiations, it was agreed that
Robert would be put on probation and have regular sessions with a prominent Harley Street
psychiatrist in London.”
On probation?
Here we have two very brilliant young students, each of whom runs into a problem that imperils
his college career. Langan s mother has missed a deadline for his financial aid. Oppenheimer
has tried to poison his tutor. To continue on, they are required to plead their cases to authority.
And what happensLangan gets his scholarship taken away, and Oppenheimer gets sent to a
psychiatrist. Oppenheimer and Langan might both be geniuses, but in other ways, they could
not be more different.
The story of Oppenheimer's appointment to be scientific director of the Manhattan Project
twenty years later is perhaps an even better example of this difference. The gen eral in charge
of the Manhattan Project was Leslie Groves, and he scoured the country, trying to find the right
person to lead the atomic-bomb effort. Oppenheimer, by rights,
was a long shot. He was just thirty-eight, and junior to many of the people whom he would have
to manage. He was a theorist, and this was a job that called for experimenters and engineers.
His political affiliations were dodgy: he had all kinds of friends who were Communists. Perhaps
more striking, he had never had any administrative experience. “He was a very impractical
fellow,” one of Oppenheimer's friends later said. “He walked about with scuffed shoes and a
funny hat, and, more important, he didn't know anything about equipment.” As one Berkeley
scientist put it, more succinctly: “He couldn't run a hamburger stand.”
Oh, and by the way, in graduate school he tried to kill his tutor. This was the resume of the man
Page 40/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
who was trying out for what might be said to bewithout exaggeration one of the most important
jobs of the twentieth century. And what happened The same thing that happened twenty years
earlier at Cambridge: he got the rest of the world to see things his way.
Here are Bird and Sherwin again: “Oppenheimer understood that Groves guarded the entrance
to the Manhattan Project, and he therefore turned on all his charm and bril liance. It was an
irresistible performance.” Groves was smitten. “'He's a genius,' Groves later told a reporter. 'A
real genius.' ” Groves was an engineer by training with a graduate degree from MIT, and
Oppenheimer's great insight was to appeal to that side of Groves. Bird and Sherwin go on:
"Oppenheimer was the first scientist Groves had met on his tour [of potential candidates] who
grasped that building an atomic bomb required finding practical solutions to a variety of crossdisciplinary problems [Groves]
found himself nodding in agreement when Oppenheimer pitched the notion of a central
laboratory devoted to this purpose, where, as he later testified, 'we could begin to come to grips
with chemical, metallurgical, engineering and ordnance problems that had so far received no
consideration/ "
Would Oppenheimer have lost his scholarship at ReedW ould he have been unable to convince
his professors to move his classes to the afternoonOf course not. And that's not because he was
smarter than Chris Langan. It's because he possessed the kind of savvy that allowed him to get
what he wanted from the world.
“They required that everyone take introductory calculus,” Langan said of his brief stay at
Montana State. “And I happened to get a guy who taught it in a very dry, very trivial way. I
didn't understand why he was teaching it this way. So I asked him questions. I actually had to
chase him down to his office. I asked him, 'Why are you teaching this way Why do you consider
this practice to be relevant to calculus?' A nd this guy, this tall, lanky guy, always had sweat
stains under his arms, he turned and looked at me and said, 'Y ou know, there is something you
should probably get straight. Some people just don't have the intellectual firepower to be
mathematicians.' ”
There they are, the professor and the prodigy, and what the prodigy clearly wants is to be
engaged, at long last, with a mind that loves mathematics as much as he does. But he fails. In
factand this is the most heartbreaking part of allhe manages to have an entire conversation with
his calculus professor without ever communicating the one fact most likely to appeal to a
calculus professor.
The professor never realizes that Chris Langan is good at calculus.

The particular skill that allows you to talk your way out of a murder rap, or convince your
professor to move you from the morning to the afternoon section, is what the psy chologist
Robert Sternberg calls “practical intelligence.,, To Sternberg, practical intelligence includes
things like ”knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it
for maximum effect.“ It is procedural: it is about knowing how to do something without
necessarily knowing why you know it or being able to explain it. It's practical in nature: that is,
it's not knowledge for its own sake. It's knowledge that helps you read situations correctly and
Page 41/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
get what you want. And, critically, it is a kind of intelligence separate from the sort of analytical
ability measured by IQ. To use the technical term, general intelligence and practical intelligence
are ”orthogonal": the presence of one doesn't imply the presence of the other. You can have
lots of analytical intelligence and very little practical intelligence, or lots of practical intelligence
and not much analytical intelligence, oras in the lucky case of someone like Robert
Oppenheimeryou can have lots of both.
So where does something like practical intelligence come fromWe know where analytical
intelligence comes from. It's something, at least in part, that's in your genes. Chris Langan
started talking at six months. He taught ioI himself to read at three years of age. He was born
smart. IQ is a measure, to some degree, of innate ability.* But social savvy is knowledge. It's a
set of skills that have to be learned. It has to come from somewhere, and the place where we
seem to get these kinds of attitudes and skills is from our families.
Perhaps the best explanation we have of this process comes from the sociologist Annette
Lareau, who a few years ago conducted a fascinating study of a group of third graders. She
picked both blacks and whites and children from both wealthy homes and poor homes, zeroing
in, ultimately, on twelve families. Lareau and her team visited each family at least twenty times,
for hours at a stretch. She and her assistants told their subjects to treat them like “the family
dog,” and they followed them to church and to soccer games and to doctor's appointments, with
a tape recorder in one hand and a notebook in the other.
You might expect that if you spent such an extended period in twelve different households,
what you would gather is twelve different ideas about how to raise children: there would be the
strict parents and the lax parents and the hyperinvolved parents and the mellow parents and on
and on. What Lareau found, however, is something much different. There were only two
parenting “philosophies,” and they divided almost perfectly along class lines. The wealthier
parents raised their kids one way, and the poorer parents raised their kids another way.
The wealthier parents were heavily involved in their children's free time, shuttling them from
one activity to * Most estimates put the heritability of IQ at roughly 50 percent.
the next, quizzing them about their teachers and coaches and teammates. One of the well-off
children Lareau followed played on a baseball team, two soccer teams, a swim team, and a
basketball team in the summer, as well as playing in an orchestra and taking piano lessons.
That kind of intensive scheduling was almost entirely absent from the lives of the poor children.
Play for them wasn't soccer practice twice a week. It was making up games outside with their
siblings and other kids in the neighborhood. What a child did was considered by his or her
parents as something separate from the adult world and not particularly consequential. One girl
from a working-class familyKatie Brindlesang in a choir after school.But she signed up for it
herself and walked to choir practice on her own. Lareau writes:
What Mrs. Brindle doesn't do that is routine for middleclass mothers is view her daughter's
interest in singing as a signal to look for other ways to help her develop that interest into a
formal talent. Similarly Mrs. Brindle does not discuss Katie's interest in drama or express regret
that she cannot afford to cultivate her daughter's talent. Instead she frames Katie's skills and
interests as character traitssinging and acting are part of what makes Katie “Katie.” She sees the
Page 42/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
shows her daughter puts on as “cute” and as a way for Katie to “get attention.”
The middle-class parents talked things through with their children, reasoning with them. They
didn't just issue commands. They expected their children to talk back to them, to negotiate, to
question adults in positions of authority. If their children were doing poorly at school, the
wealthier parents challenged their teachers. They intervened on behalf of their kids. One child
Lareau follows just misses qualifying for a gifted program. Her mother arranges for her to be
retested privately, petitions the school, and gets her daughter admitted. The poor parents, by
contrast, are intimidated by authority. They react passively and stay in the background. Lareau
writes of one low-income parent:
At a parent-teacher conference, for example, Ms. McAllister (who is a high school graduate)
seems subdued. The gregarious and outgoing nature she displays at home is hidden in this
setting. She sits hunched over in the chair and she keeps her jacket zipped up. She is very
quiet. When the teacher reports that Harold has not been turning in his homework, Ms.
McAllister clearly is flabbergasted, but all she says is, “He did it at home.” She does not follow
up with the teacher or attempt to intervene on Harold's behalf. In her view, it is up to the
teachers to manage her son's education. That is their job, not hers.
Lareau calls the middle-class parenting style “concerted cultivation.” It's an attempt to actively
“foster and assess a child's talents, opinions and skills.” Poor parents tend to follow, by contrast,
a strategy of “accomplishment of natural growth.” They see as their responsibility to care for
their children but to let them grow and develop on their own.
Lareau stresses that one style isn't morally better than the other. The poorer children were, to
her mind, often better behaved, less whiny, more creative in making use of their own time, and
had a well-developed sense of independence. But in practical terms, concerted cultivation has
enormous advantages. The heavily scheduled middleclass child is exposed to a constantly shifting
set of experiences. She learns teamwork and how to cope in highly structured settings. She is
taught how to interact comfortably with adults, and to speak up when she needs to. In Lareau's
words, the middle-class children learn a sense of “entitlement.”
That word, of course, has negative connotations these days. But Lareau means it in the best
sense of the term: “They acted as though they had a right to pursue their own individual
preferences and to actively manage interactions in institutional settings. They appeared
comfortable in those settings; they were open to sharing information and asking for attention It
was common practice among middle-class children to shift interactions to suit their preferences.”
They knew the rules. “Even in fourth grade, middle-class children appeared to be acting on their
own behalf to gain advantages. They made special requests of teachers and doctors to adjust
procedures to accommodate their desires.”
By contrast, the working-class and poor children were characterized by “an emerging sense of
distance, distrust, and constraint.” They didn't know how to get their way, or how to
“customize”using Lareau's wonderful termwhatever environment they were in, for their best
purposes.
In one telling scene, Lareau describes a visit to the doctor by Alex Williams, a nine-year-old boy,
and his mother, Christina. The Williamses are wealthy professionals.
Page 43/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
“Alex, you should be thinking of questions you might want to ask the doctor,” Christina says in
the car on the way to the doctor's office. “You can ask him anything you want. Don't be shy.
You can ask anything.”
Alex thinks for a minute, then says, “I have some bumps under my arms from my deodorant.”
Christina: “ReallyYou mean from your new deodorant?” Alex: “Yes.” Christina: “Well, you
should ask the doctor.”
Alex's mother, Lareau writes, “is teaching that he has the right to speak up”that even though
he's going to be in a room with an older person and authority figure, it's perfectly all right for
him to assert himself. They meet the doctor, a genial man in his early forties. He tells Alex that
he is in the ninety-fifth percentile in height. Alex then interrupts:
ALEX: I'm in the what
DOCTOR: It means that you're taller than more than ninety-five out of a hundred young men
when they're,
uh, ten years old. ALEX: I'm not ten.
DOCTOR: W ell, they graphed you at ten. Y ou'renine years and ten months. Theythey usually
take the closest year to that graph.
Look at how easily Alex interrupts the doctor“I'm not ten.” That's entitlement: his mother
permits that casual incivility because she wants him to learn to assert himself with people in
positions of authority.
THE DOCTOR TURNS TO ALEX: Well, now the most important question. Do you have any
questions you want to ask me before I do your physical?
ALEX: Um...only one. I've been getting some bumps on my arms, right around here (indicates
underarm).
DOCTOR: Underneath
ALEX: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll have to take a look at those when I come in closer to do the checkup. And
I'll see what they are and what I can do. Do they hurt or itch
ALEX: No, they're just there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll take a look at those bumps for you.
This kind of interaction simply doesn't happen with lower-class children, Lareau says. They
would be quiet and submissive, with eyes turned away. Alex takes charge of the moment. “In
remembering to raise the question he prepared in advance, he gains the doctor's full attention
and focuses it on an issue of his choosing,” Lareau writes.
In so doing, he successfully shifts the balance of power away from the adults and toward himself.
The transition goes smoothly. Alex is used to being treated with respect. He is seen as special
and as a person worthy of adult attention and interest. These are key characteristics of the
Page 44/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
strategy of concerted cultivation. Alex is not showing off during his checkup. He is behaving
much as he does with his parentshe reasons, negotiates, and jokes with equal ease.
It is important to understand where the particular mastery of that moment comes from. It's not
genetic. Alex Williams didn't inherit the skills to interact with authority figures from his parents
and grandparents the way he inherited the color of his eyes. Nor is it racial: it's not a practice
specifie to either black or white people. As it turns out, Alex Williams is black and Katie Brindle
is white. It's a cultural advantage. Alex has those skills because over the course of his young life,
his mother and fatherin the manner of educated familieshave painstakingly taught them to him,
nudging and prodding and encouraging and showing him the rules of the game, right down to
that lit tle rehearsal in the car on the way to the doctor's office.
When we talk about the advantages of class, Lareau argues, this is in large part what we mean.
Alex Williams is better off than Katie Brindle because he's wealthier and because he goes to a
better school, but also becauseand perhaps this is even more criticalthe sense of entitlement that
he has been taught is an attitude perfectly suited to succeeding in the modern world.

This is the advantage that Oppenheimer had and that Chris Langan lacked. Oppenheimer was
raised in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Manhattan, the son of an artist and a successful
garment manufacturer. His childhood was the embodiment of concerted cultivation. O n
weekends, the Oppenheimers would go driving in the countryside in a chauffeur-driven Packard.
Summers he would be taken to Europe to see his grandfather. He attended the Ethical Culture
School on Central Park West, perhaps the most progressive school in the nation, where, his
biographers write, students were “infused with the notion that they were being groomed to
reform the world.” When his math teacher realized he was bored, she sent him off to do
independent work.
As a child, Oppenheimer was passionate about rock collecting. At the age of twelve, he began
corresponding with local geologists about rock formations he had seen in Central Park, and he
so impressed them that they invited him to give a lecture before the New York Mineralogical
Club. As Sherwin and Bird write, Oppenheimer's parents responded to their son's hobby in an
almost textbook example of concerted cultivation:
Dreading the thought of having to talk to an audience of adults, Robert begged his father to
explain that they had invited a twelve-year-old. Greatly amused, Julius encouraged his son to
accept this honor. On the designated evening, Robert showed up at the club with his parents,
who proudly introduced their son as J. Robert Oppenheimer. The startled audience of geologists
and amateur rock collectors burst out laughing when he stepped up to the podium: a wooden
box had to be found for him to stand on so that the audience could see more than the shock of
his wiry black hair sticking up above the lectern. Shy and awkward, Robert nevertheless read his
prepared remarks and was given a hearty round of applause.
Is it any wonder Oppenheimer handled the challenges of his life so brilliantlyIf you are someone
whose father has made his way up in the business world, then you've seen, firsthand, what it
means to negotiate your way out of a tight spot. If you're someone who was sent to the Ethical
Culture School, then you aren't going to be intimidated by a row of Cambridge dons arrayed in
Page 45/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
judgment against you. If you studied physics at Harvard, then you know how to talk to an army
general who did engineering just down the road atMIT.
Chris Langan, by contrast, had only the bleakness of Bozeman, and a home dominated by an
angry, drunken stepfather. “[Jack] Langan did this to all of us,” said Mark. “We all have a true
resentment of authority.” That was the lesson Langan learned from his childhood: distrust
authority and be independent. He never had a parent teach him on the way to the doctor how
to speak up for himself, or how to reason and negotiate with those in positions of authority. He
didn't learn entitlement. He learned constraint. It may seem like a small thing, but it was a
crippling handicap in navigating the world beyond Bozeman.
“I couldn't get any financial aid either,” Mark went on. “We just had zero knowledge, less than
zero knowledge, of the process. How to apply. The forms. Checkbooks. It was not our
environment.”
“If Christopher had been born into a wealthy family, if he was the son of a doctor who was well
connected in some major market, I guarantee you he would have been one of those guys you
read about, knocking back PhDs at seventeen,” his brother Jeff says. “It's the culture you find
yourself in that determines that. The issue with Chris is that he was always too bored to actually
sit there and listen to his teachers. If someone had recognized his intelligence and if he was
from a family where there was some kind of value on education, they would have made sure he
wasn't bored.”

When the Termites were into their adulthood, Terman looked at the records of 730 of the men
and divided them into three groups. One hundred and fiftythe top 20 percentfell into what
Terman called the A group. They were the true success stories, the starsthe lawyers and
physicians and engineers and academics. Ninety percent of the As graduated from college and
among them had earned 98 graduate degrees. The middle 60 percent were the B group, those
who were doing “satisfactorily.” The bottom 150 were the Cs, the ones who Terman judged to
have done the least with their superior mental ability. They were the postal workers and the
struggling bookkeepers and the men lying on their couches at home without any job at all.
One third of the Cs were college dropouts. A quarter only had a high school diploma, and all
150 of the Cs each one of whom, at one point in his life, had been dubbed a geniushad
together earned a grand total of eight graduate degrees.
What was the difference between the As and the CsTerman ran through every conceivable
explanation. He looked at their physical and mental health, their “mas culinity-femininity
scores,” and their hobbies and vocational interests. He compared the ages when they started
walking and talking and what their precise IQ scores were in elementary and high school. In the
end, only one thing mattered: family background.
The As overwhelmingly came from the middle and the upper class. Their homes were filled with
books. Half the fathers of the A group had a college degree or beyond, and this at a time when
a university education was a rarity. The Cs, on the other hand, were from the other side of the
tracks. Almost a third of them had a parent who had dropped out of school before the eighth
grade.
Page 46/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
At one point, Terman had his fleldworkers go and visit everyone from the A and C groups and
rate their personalities and manner. What they found is everything you would expect to find if
you were comparing children raised in an atmosphere of concerted cultivation with children
raised in an atmosphere of natural growth. The As were judged to be much more alert, poised,
attractive, and well dressed. In fact, the scores on those four dimensions are so different as to
make you think you are looking at two different species of humans. You aren't, of course.
You're simply seeing the difference between those schooled by their families to present their
best face to the world, and those denied that experience.
The Terman results are deeply distressing. Let's not forget how highly gifted the C group was. If
you had met them at five or six years of age, you would have been overwhelmed by their
curiosity and mental agility and sparkle. They were true outliers. The plain truth of the Terman
study, however, is that in the end almost none of the genius children from the lowest social and
economic class ended up making a name for themselves.
What did the Cs lack, thoughNot something expensive or impossible to find; not something
encoded in D N A or hardwired into the circuits of their brains. They lacked something that
could have been given to them if we'd only known they needed it: a community around them
that prepared them properly for the world. The Cs were squandered talent. But they didn't need
to be.
6.
Today, Chris Langan lives in rural Missouri on a horse farm. He moved there a few years ago,
after he got married. He is in his fifties but looks many years younger. He has the build of a
linebacker, thick through the chest, with enormous biceps. His hair is combed straight back from
his forehead. He has a neat, graying moustache and aviator-style glasses. If you look into his
eyes, you can see the intelligence burning behind them.
“A typical day is, I get up and make coffee. I go in and sit in front of the computer and begin
working on whatever I was working on the night before,” he told me not long ago. “I found if I
go to bed with a question on my mind, all I have to do is concentrate on the question before I go
to sleep and I virtually always have the answer in the morning. Sometimes I realize what the
answer is because I dreamt the answer and I can remember it. Other times I just feel the
answer, and I start typing and the answer emerges onto the page.”
He had just been reading the work of the linguist Noam Chomsky. There were piles of books in
his study. He ordered books from the library all the time. “I always feel that the closer you get to
the original sources, the better off you are,” he said.
Langan seemed content. He had farm animals to take care of, and books to read, and a wife he
loved. It was a much better life than being a bouncer.
“I don't think there is anyone smarter than me out there,” he went on. “I have never met
anybody like me or never seen even an indication that there is somebody who actually has
better powers of comprehension. Never seen it and I don't think I am going to. I couldmy mind
is open to the possibility. If anyone should challenge me'Oh, I think that I am smarter than you
are' I think I could have them.”
Page 47/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
What he said sounded boastful, but it wasn't really. It was the oppositea touch defensive. He'd
been working for decades now on a project of enormous sophisticationbut almost none of what
he had done had ever been published much less read by the physicists and philosophers and
mathematicians who might be able to judge its value. Here he was, a man with a one-in-amillion mind, and he had yet to have any impact on the world. He wasn't holding forth at
academic conferences. He wasn't leading a graduate seminar at some prestigious university. He
was living on a slightly tumbledown horse farm in northern Mis souri, sitting on the back porch
in jeans and a cutoff Tshirt. He knew how it looked: it was the great paradox of Chris Langan's
genius.
“I have not pursued mainstream publishers as hard as I should have,” he conceded. “Going
around, querying publishers, trying to find an agent. I haven't done it, and I am not interested in
doing it.”
It was an admission of defeat. Every experience he had had outside of his own mind had ended
in frustration. He knew he needed to do a better job of navigating the world, but he didn't know
how. He couldn't even talk to his calculus teacher, for goodness' sake. These were things that
others, with lesser minds, could master easily. But that's because those others had had help
along the way, and Chris Langan never had. It wasn't an excuse. It was a fact. He'd had to make
his way alone, and no onenot rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and
not even geniuses ever makes it alone.

CHAPTER FIVE
The Three Lessons of Joe Flom “MARY GOT A QUARTER.”
1.
Joe Flom is the last living “named ” partner of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom. He has a corner office high atop the Conde Nast tower in Manhattan. He is short and
slightly hunched. His head is large, framed by long prominent ears, and his narrow blue eyes are
hidden by oversize aviator-style glasses. He is slender now, but during his heyday, Flom was
extremely overweight. He waddles when he walks. He doodles when he thinks. He mumbles
when he talks, and when he makes his way down the halls of Skadden, Arps, conversations
drop to a hush.
Flom grew up in the Depression in Brooklyn's Borough Park neighborhood. His parents were
Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. His father, Isadore, was a union organizer in the
garment industry who later went to work sewing shoulder pads for ladies' dresses. His mother
worked at what was called pieceworkdoing applique at home. They were desperately poor. His
family moved nearly every year when he was growing up because the custom in those days was
for landlords to give new tenants a month's free rent, and without that, his family could not get
by.
In junior high school, Flom took the entrance exam for the elite Townsend Harris public high
school on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, a school that in just forty years of existence
produced three Nobel Prize winners, six Pulitzer Prize winners, and one Supreme Court Justice,
not to mention George Gershwin and Jonas Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine. He got in.
His mother would give him a dime in the morning for breakfastthree donuts, orange juice, and
coffee at Nedick's. After school, he pushed a hand truck in the garment district. He did two
years of night school at City College in upper Manhattanworking during the days to make ends
meetsigned up for the army, served his time, and applied to Harvard Law School.
“I wanted to get into the law since I was six years old,” Flom says. He didn't have a degree from
college. Harvard took him anyway. “WhyI wrote them a letter on why I was the answer to sliced
bread,” is how Flom explains it, with characteristic brevity. At Harvard, in the late 1940s, he
never took notes. “All of us were going through this first year idiocy of writing notes carefully in
the classroom and doing an outline of that, then a condensation of that, and then doing it again
on onionskin paper, on top of other paper,” remembers Charles Haar, who was a classmate of
Flom's. “It was a routinized way of trying to learn the cases. Not Joe. He wouldn't have any of
that. But he had that quality which we always vaguely subsumed under 'thinking like a lawyer.'
He had the great capacity for judgment.”
Flom was named to the Law Reviewan honor reserved for the very top students in the class.
During “hiring season,” the Christmas break of his second year, he went down to New York to
interview with the big corporate law firms of the day. “I was ungainly, awkward, a fat kid. I didn't
feel comfortable,” Flom remembers. “I was one of two kids in my class at the end of hiring
Page 49/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
season who didn't have a job. Then one day, one of my professors said that there are these
guys starting a firm. I had a visit with them, and the entire time I met with them, they were
telling me what the risks were of going with a firm that didn't have a client. The more they
talked, the more I liked them. So I said, What the hell, I'll take a chance. They had to scrape
together the thirty-six hundred a year, which was the starting salary.” In the beginning, it was
just Marshall Skadden, Leslie A rps both of whom had just been turned down for partner at a
major W all Street law firmand John Slate, who had worked for Pan Am airlines. Flom was their
associate. They had a tiny suite of offices on the top floor of the Lehman Brothers Building on
Wall Street. “What kind of law did we do?” Flom says, laughing. “Whatever came in the door!”
In 1954, Flom took over as Skadden's managing partner, and the firm began to grow by leaps
and bounds. Soon it had one hundred lawyers. Then two hundred. When it hit three hundred,
one of Flom's partnersMorris Kramercame to him and said that he felt guilty about bringing in
young law school graduates. Skadden was so big, Kramer said, that it was hard to imagine the
firm growing beyond that and being able to promote any of those hires. Flom told him, “Ahhh,
we'll go to one thousand.” Flom never lacked for ambition.
Today Skadden, Arps has nearly two thousand attorneys in twenty-three offices around the
world and earns well over $i billion a year, making it one of the largest and most powerful law
firms in the world. In his office, Flom has pictures of himself with George Bush Sr. and Bill
Clinton. He lives in a sprawling apartment in a luxurious building on Manhattan's Upper East
Side. For a period of almost thirty years, if you were a Fortune 500company about to be taken
over or trying to take over someone else, or merely a big shot in some kind of fix, Joseph Flom
has been your attorney and Skadden, Arps has been your law firmand if they weren't, you
probably wished they were.
2.
I hope by now that you are skeptical of this kind of story. Brilliant immigrant kid overcomes
poverty and the Depression, can't get a job at the stuffy downtown law firms, makes it on his
own through sheer hustle and ability. It's a rags-to-riches story, and everything we've learned so
far from hockey players and software billionaires and the Termites suggests that success doesn't
happen that way. Successful people don't do it alone. Where they come from matters. They're
products of particular places and environments.
Just as we did, then, with BillJoy and Chris Langan, let's start over with Joseph Flom, this time
putting to use everything we've learned from the first four chapters of this book. No more talk
of Joe Flom's intelligence, or personality, or ambition, though he obviously has these three
things in abundance. N o glowing quotations from his clients, testifying to his genius. No more
colorful tales from the meteoric rise of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom.
Instead, Fm going to tell a series of stories from the New York immigrant world that Joe Flom
grew up inof a fellow law student, a father and son named Maurice and Mort Janklow, and an
extraordinary couple by the name of Louis and Regina Borgenichtin the hopes of answering a
critical question. What were Joe Flom's opportunitiesSince we know that outliers always have
help along the way, can we sort through the ecology of Joe Flom and identify the conditions
that helped create him?
Page 50/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
We tell rags-to-riches stories because we find something captivating in the idea of a lone hero
battling overwhelming odds. But the true story of Joe Flom's life turns out to be much more
intriguing than the mythological version because all the things in his life that seem to have been
disadvantagesthat he was a poor child of garment workers; that he was Jewish at a time when
Jews were heavily discriminated against; that he grew up in the Depressionturn out,
unexpectedly, to have been advantages. Joe Flom is an outlier. But he's not an outlier for the
reasons you might think, and the story of his rise provides a blueprint for understanding success
in his profession. By the end of the chapter, in fact, we'll see that it is possible to take the
lessons of Joe Flom, apply them to the legal world of New York City, and predict the family
background, age, and origin of the city's most powerful attorneys , without knowing a single
additional fact about them. But we're getting ahead of ourselves.
Lesson Number One: The Importance of Being Jewish
3.
One of Joe Flom's classmates at Harvard Law School was a man named Alexander Bickel. Like
Flom, Bickel was the son of Eastern European Jewish immigrants who lived in Brooklyn. Like
Flom, Bickel had gone to public school in New York and then to City College. Like Flom, Bickel
was a star in his law school class. In fact, before his career was cut short by cancer, Bickel would
become perhaps the finest constitutional scholar of his generation. And like Flom and the rest of
their law school classmates, Bickel went to Manhattan during “hiring season” over Christmas of
1947 to find himself a job.
His first stop was at Mudge Rose, down on Wall Street, as traditional and stuffy as any firm of
that era. Mudge Rose was founded in 1869. It was where Richard Nixon practiced in the years
before he won the presidency in 1968. “Were like the lady who only wants her name in the
newspaper twicewhen she's born and when she dies,” one of the senior partners famously said.
Bickel was taken around the firm and interviewed by one partner after another, until he was led
into the library to meet with the firm's senior partner. You can imagine the scene: a darkpaneled room, an artfully frayed Persian carpet, row upon row of leather-bound legal volumes,
oil paintings of Mr. Mudge and Mr. Rose on the wall.
“After they put me through the whole interview and everything,” Bickel said many years later, “I
was brought to [the senior partner], who took it upon himself to tell me that for a boy of my
antecedents“ and you can imagine how Bickel must have paused before repeating that
euphemism for his immigrant background”I certainly had come far. But I ought to understand
how limited the possibilities of a firm like his were to hire a boy of my antecedents. And while
he congratulated me on my progress, I should understand he certainly couldn't offer me a job.
But they all enjoyed seeing me and all that.”
It is clear from the transcript of Bickel's reminiscences that his interviewer does not quite know
what to do with that information. Bickel was by the time of the interview at the height of his
reputation. He had argued cases before the Supreme Court. He had written brilliant books.
Mudge Rose saying no to Bickel because of his “antecedents” was like the Chicago Bulls turning
down Michael Jordan because they were uncomfortable with black kids from North Carolina. It
didn't make any sense.
Page 51/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
“But for stars?” the interviewer asked, meaning, Wouldn't they have made an exception for you

BICKEL: “Stars, schmars...”
In the 1940s and 1950s, the old-line law firms of New York operated like a private club. They
were all headquartered in downtown Manhattan, in and around Wall Street, in somber, granitefaced buildings. The partners at the top firms graduated from the same Ivy League schools,
attended the same churches, and summered in the same oceanside towns on Long Island. They
wore conservative gray suits. Their partnerships were known as “white-shoe” firmsin apparent
reference to the white bucks favored at the country club or a cocktail party, and they were very
particular in whom they hired. As Erwin Smigel wrote in The Wall Street Lawyer, his study of
the New York legal establishment of that era, they were looking for:
lawyers who are Nordic, have pleasing personalities and “clean-cut” appearances, are graduates
of the “right schools,” have the “right” social background and experience in the affairs of the
world, and are endowed with tremendous stamina. A former law school dean, in discussing the
qualities students need to obtain a job, offers a somewhat more realistic picture: “To get a job
[students] should be long enough on family connections, long enough on ability or long enough
on personality, or a combination of these. Something called acceptability is made up of the sum
of its parts. If a man has any of these things, he could get a job. If he has two of them, he can
have a choice of jobs; if he has three, he could go anywhere.”
Bickel's hair was not fair. His eyes were not blue. He spoke with an accent, and his family
connections consisted, principally, of being the son of Solomon and Yetta Bickel of Bucharest,
Romania, by way, most recently, of Brooklyn. Flom's credentials were no better. He says he felt
“uncomfortable” when he went for his interviews downtown, and of course he did: he was short
and ungainly and Jewish and talked with the flat, nasal tones of his native Brooklyn, and you can
imagine how he would have been perceived by some silver-haired patrician in the library. If you
were not of the right background and religion and social class and you came out of law school in
that era, you joined some smaller, second-rate, upstart law firm on a rung below the big names
downtown, or you simply went into business for yourself and took “whatever came in the
door”that is, whatever legal work the big downtown firms did not want for themselves. That
seems horribly unfair, and it was. But as is so often the case with outliers, buried in that setback
was a golden opportunity.

The old-line W all Street law firms had a very specific idea about what it was that they did. They
were corporate lawyers. They represented the country's largest and most pres tigious
companies, and “represented” meant they handled the taxes and the legal work behind the
issuing of stocks and bonds and made sure their clients did not run afoul of federal regulators.
They did not do litigation; that is, very few of them had a division dedicated to defending and
filing lawsuits. As Paul Cravath, one of the founders of Cra vath, Swaine and Moore, the very
whitest of the white-shoe firms, once put it, the lawyer's job was to settle disputes in the
conference room, not in the courtroom. “Among my classmates at Harvard, the thing that bright
young guys did was securities work or tax,” another white-shoe partner remembers. “Those
were the distinguished fields. Litiga tion was for hams, not for serious people. Corporations just
Page 52/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
didn't sue each other in those days.”
What the old-line firms also did not do was involve themselves in hostile corporate takeovers. It's
hard to imagine today, when corporate raiders and private-equity firms are constantly swallowing
up one company after another, but until the 1970s, it was considered scandalous for one
company to buy another company without the target agreeing to be bought. Places like Mudge
Rose and the other establishment firms on Wall Street would not touch those kinds of deals.
“The problem with hostile takeovers is that they were hostile/' says Steven Brill, who founded
the trade magazine American Lawyer. ”It wasn't gentlemanly. If your best buddy from Princeton
is the CEO of Company X, and he's been coasting for a long time, and some corporate raider
shows up and says this company sucks, it makes you uncomfortable. You think, If he goes, then
maybe I go too. It's this whole notion of not upsetting the basic calm and stable order of
things."*
The work that “came in the door” to the generation of Jewish lawyers from the Bronx and
Brooklyn in the 1950s and 1960s, then, was the work the white-shoe firms disdained: litigation
and, more important, “proxy fights,”
* The lawyer and novelist Louis Auchincloss, who very much belongs to the old WASP-y whiteshoe legal establishment in New York, has a scene in his book The Scarlet Letters that perfectly
captures the antipathy the downtown firms felt toward takeover law. “Face it, my dear, your
husband and I are running a firm of shysters,” a takeover attor ney explains to the wife of his
law partner.
He continues: “Nowadays when one wishes to acquire a company that doesn't wish to be
acquired, one's counsel bring all kinds of nuisance suits to induce it to change its mind. We sue
for mismanagement by the directors, for unpaid dividends, for violation of the bylaws, for
improper issuance of stock. We allege criminal misconduct; we shout about antitrust; we sue for
ancient and dubious liabilities. And our opponent's counsel will answer with inordinate demands
for all our files and seek endless interrogatories in order to enmesh our client in a hopeless
tangle of red tape It is simply war, and you know the quality that applies to that and love.”
which were the legal maneuvers at the center of any hostile-takeover bid. An investor would
take an interest in a company; he would denounce the management as incompetent and send
letters to shareholders, trying to get them to give him their “proxy” so he could vote out the
firm's executives. And to run the proxy fight, the only lawyer the investor could get was
someone like Joe Flom.
In Skadden, the legal historian Lincoln Caplan describes that early world of takeovers:
The winner of a proxy contest was determined in the snake pit. (Officially, it was called the
counting room.) Lawyers for each side met with inspectors of elections, whose job it was to
approve or eliminate questionable proxies. The event was often informal, contentious and
unruly. Adversaries were sometimes in T-shirts, eating watermelon or sharing a bottle of scotch.
In rare cases, the results of the snake pit could swing the outcome of a contest and turn on a
single ballot.
Lawyers occasionally tried to fix an election by engineering the appointment of inspectors who
Page 53/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
were beholden to them; inspectors commonly smoked cigars provided by each side.
Management's lawyer would contest the proxies of the insurgents (“I challenge this!”) and vice
versa Lawyers who prevailed in the snake pit excelled at winging it. There were lawyers who
knew more about the rules of proxy contests, but no one was better in a fight than Joe Flom...
Flom was fat (a hundred pounds overweight then, one lawyer said...), physically unattractive (to a
partner, he resembled a frog), and indifferent to social niceties (he would fart in public or jab a
cigar close to the face of someone he was talking to, without apology). But in the judgment of
colleagues and of some adversaries, his will to win was unsurpassed and he was often masterful.
The white-shoe law firms would call in Flom as well whenever some corporate raider made a
run at one of their establishment clients. They wouldn't touch the case. But they were happy to
outsource it to Skadden, Arps. “Flom's early specialty was proxy fights, and that was not what
we did, just like we don't do matrimonial work,” said Robert Rif kind, a longtime partner at
Cravath, Swaine and Moore. “And therefore we purported not to know about it. I remember
once we had an issue involving a proxy fight, and one of my senior corporate partners said,
Well, let's get Joe in. And he came to a conference room, and we all sat around and described
the problem and he told us what to do and he left. And I said, 'We can do that too, you know.'
And the partner said, 'No, no, no, you can't. We're not going to do that.' It was just that we
didn't do it.”
Then came the 1970s. The old aversion to lawsuits fell by the wayside. It became easier to
borrow money. Federal regulations were relaxed. Markets became internationalized. Investors
became more aggressive, and the result was a boom in the number and size of corporate
takeovers. “In nineteen eighty, if you went to the Business Roundtable [the association of major
American corporate executives] and took surveys about whether hostile takeovers should be
allowed, two-thirds would have said no,” Flom said. “Now, the vote would be almost
unanimously yes.” Companies needed to be defended against lawsuits from rivals. Hostile suitors
needed to be beaten back. Investors who wanted to devour unwilling targets needed help with
their legal strategy, and shareholders needed formal representation. The dollar figures involved
were enormous. From the mid-1970s to the end of the 1980s, the amount of money involved
in mergers and acquisitions every year on Wall Street increased 2,000 percent, peaking at
almost a quarter of a trillion dollars.
All of a sudden the things that the old-line law firms didn't want to dohostile takeovers and
litigationwere the things that every law firm wanted to do. And who was the expert in these two
suddenly critical areas of law The once marginal, second-tier law firms started by the people
who couldn't get jobs at the downtown firms ten and fifteen years earlier.
“[The white-shoe firms] thought hostile takeovers were beneath contempt until relatively late in
the game, and until they decided that, hey, maybe we ought to be in that business, they left me
alone,” Flom said. “And once you get the reputation for doing that kind of work, the business
comes to you first.”
Think of how similar this is to the stories of Bill Joy and Bill Gates. Both of them toiled away in
a relatively obscure field without any great hopes for worldly success. But thenboom!the
personal computer revolution happened, and they had their ten thousand hours in. They were
ready. Flom had the same experience. For twenty years he perfected his craft at Skadden, Arps.
Page 54/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Then the world changed and he was ready. He didn't triumph over adversity. Instead, what
started out as adversity ended up being an opportunity.
“It's not that those guys were smarter lawyers than anyone else,“ Rif kind says. ”It's that they
had a skill that they had been working on for years that was suddenly very valuable.”*
Lesson Number Two:Demographic Luck
5.
Maurice Janklow enrolled in Brooklyn Law School in 1919. He was the eldest son of Jewish
immigrants from Romania. He had seven brothers and sisters. One ended up running a small
department store in Brooklyn. Two others were in the haberdashery business, one had a
graphic design studio, another made feather hats, and another worked in the finance
department at Tishman Realty. Maurice, however, was the family intellectual, the only one to go
to college. He got his law degree and set up a practice on Court Street in downtown Brooklyn.
He was an elegant man who dressed in a homburg and Brooks Brothers * The best analysis of
how adversity turned into opportunity for Jewish lawyers has been done by the legal scholar Eli
Wald. Wald is careful to make the point, however, that Flom and his ilk weren't merely lucky.
Lucky is winning the lottery. They were given an opportunity, and they seized it. As Wald says:
“Jewish lawyers were lucky and they helped themselves. That's the best way to put it. They
took advantage of the circumstances that came their way. The lucky part was the unwillingness
of the WASP firms to step into takeover law. But that word luck fails to capture the work and
the efforts and the imagination and the acting on opportunities that might have been hidden and
not so obvious.”
suits. In the summer, he wore a straw boater. He married the very beautiful Lillian Levantin,
who was the daughter of a prominent Talmudist. He drove a big car. He moved to Queens. He
and a partner then took over a writing-paper business that gave every indication of making a
fortune.
Here was a man who looked, for all the world, like the kind of person who should thrive as a
lawyer in New York City. He was intelligent and educated. He came from a family well schooled
in the rules of the system. He was living in the most economically vibrant city in the world. But
here is the strange thing: it never happened. Maurice Janklow's career did not take off the way
that he'd hoped. In his mind, he never really made it beyond Court Street in Brooklyn. He
struggled and floundered.
Maurice Janklow had a son named Mort, however, who became a lawyer as well, and the son's
story is very different from that of the father. Mort Janklow built a law firm from scratch in the
1960s, then put together one of the very earliest cable television franchises and sold it for a
fortune to Cox Broadcasting. He started a literary agency in the 1970s, and it is today one of
the most prestigious in the world.* He has his own plane. Every dream that eluded the father
was fulfilled by the son.
Why did Mort Janklow succeed where Maurice Janklow did notThere are, of course, a hundred
potential answers to that question. But let's take a page from the analysis of the business
tycoons born in the 1830s and the software programmers born in 1955 and look at the differPage 55/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
* Janklow and Nesbit, the agency he started, is, in fact, my literary agency. That is how I heard
about Janklow's family history.
ences between the two Janklows in terms of their generation. Is there a perfect time for a New
York Jewish lawyer to be bornIt turns out there is, and this same fact that helps explain Mort
Janklow's success is the second key to Joe Flom's success as well.
6.
Lewis Terman's genius study, as you will recall from the chapter about Chris Langan, was an
investigation into how some children with really high IQs who were born between 1903and
1917 turned out as adults. And the study found that there was a group of real successes and
there was a group of real failures, and that the successes were far more likely to have come
from wealthier families. In that sense, the Terman study underscores the argument Annette
Lareau makes, that what your parents do for a living, and the assumptions that accompany the
class your parents belong to, matter.
There's another way to break down the Terman results, though, and that's by when the
Termites were born. If you divide the Termites into two groups, with those born be tween 1903
and 1911 on one side, and those between 1912 and 1917 on the other, it turns out that the
Terman failures are far more likely to have been born in the earlier group.
The explanation has to do with two of the great cataclysmic events of the twentieth century: the
Great Depression and World War II. If you were born after 1912 say, in 1915you got out of
college after the worst of the Depression was over, and you were drafted at a young enough age
that going away to war for three or four years was as much an opportunity as it was a disruption
(provided you weren't killed, of course).
The Termites born before 1911, though, graduated from college at the height of the
Depression, when job opportunities were scarce, and they were already in their late thirties
when the Second W orld W ar hit, meaning that when they were drafted, they had to disrupt
careers and families and adult lives that were already well under way. To have been born before
1911 is to have been demographically unlucky. The most devastating events of the twentieth
century hit you at exactly the wrong time.
This same demographic logic applies to Jewish lawyers in New York like Maurice Janklow. The
doors were closed to them at the big downtown law firms. So they were overwhelmingly solo
practitioners, handling wills and divorces and contracts and minor disputes, and in the
Depression the work of the solo practitioner all but disappeared. “Nearly half of the members of
the metropolitan bar earned less than the minimum subsistence level for American families,”
Jerold Auerbach writes of the Depression years in New York. “One year later 1,500 lawyers
were prepared to take the pauper's oath to qualify for work relief. Jewish lawyers
(approximately one-half of the metropolitan bar) discovered that their practice had become a
'dignified road to starvation.' ” Regardless of the number of years they had spent in practice,
their income was “strikingly less” than that of their Christian colleagues. Maurice Janklow was
born in 1902. When the Depression started, he was newly married and had just bought his big
car, moved to Queens, and made his great gamble on the writing-paper business. His timing
could not have been worse.
Page 56/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
“He was going to make a fortune,” Mort Janklow says of his father. "But the Depression killed
him economically. He didn't have any reserves, and he had no family to fall back on. And from
then on, he became very much a scrivener-type lawyer. He didn't have the courage to take risks
after that. It was too much for him. My father used to close titles for twenty-five dollars. He had
a friend who worked at the Jamaica Savings Bank who would throw him some business. He
would kill himself for twenty-five bucks, doing the whole closing, title reports. For twentyfive
bucks!
“I can remember my father and mother in the morning,” Janklow continued. “He would say to
her, 'I got a dollar seventy-five. I need ten cents for the bus, ten cents for the subway, a quarter
for a sandwich,' and he would give her the rest. They were that close to the edge.”
7.
Now contrast that experience with the experience of someone who, like Mort Janklow, was
born in the 1930s.
Take a look at the following chart, which shows the birthrates in the United States from 1910 to
1950. In 1915, there are almost three million babies. In 1935, that number drops by almost six
hundred thousand, and then, within a decade and a half, the number is back over three million
again. To put it in more precise terms, for every thousand Americans, there were 29.5 babies
born in 1915; 18.7 babies born in 1935; and 24.1 babies born in 1950. The decade of 1910
1915 1920 1925 1930 1935 1940 1945 1950 Total Births Births per 1,000 2,777,000 30.1
2,965,000 29.5 2,950,000 27.7 2,909,000 25.1 2,618,000 21.3 2,377,000 18.7
2,559,000 19.4 2,858,000 20.4 3,632,000 24.1 the 1930s is what is called a “demographic
trough.” In response to the economic hardship of the Depression, families simply stopped
having children, and as a result, the generation born during that decade was markedly smaller
than both the generation that preceded it and the generation that immediately followed it.
Here is what the economist H. Scott Gordon once wrote about the particular benefits of being
one of those people born in a small generation:
When he opens his eyes for the first time, it is in a spacious hospital, well-appointed to serve
the wave that preceded him. The staff is generous with their time, since they have little to do
while they ride out the brief period of calm until the next wave hits. When he comes to school
age, the magnificent buildings are already there to receive him; the ample staff of teachers
welcomes him with open arms. In high school, the basketball team is not as good as it was but
there is no problem getting time on the gymnasium floor. The university is a delightful place;
lots of room in the classes and residences, no crowding in the cafeteria, and the professors are
solicitous. Then he hits the job market. The supply of new entrants is low, and the demand is
high, because there is a large wave coming behind him providing a strong demand for the goods
and services of his potential employers.
In New York City, the early 1930s cohort was so small that class sizes were at least half of what
they had been twenty-five years earlier. The schools were new, built for the big generation that
had come before, and the teachers had what in the Depression was considered a high-status job.
“The New York City public schools of the 1940s were considered the best schools in the
country,” says Diane Ravitch, a professor at New York University who has written widely on the
Page 57/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
city's educational history. “There was this generation of educators in the thirties and forties who
would have been in another time and place college professors. They were brilliant, but they
couldn't get the jobs they wanted, and public teaching was what they did because it was security
and it had a pension and you didn't get laid off.”
The same dynamic benefited the members of that generation when they went off to college.
Here is Ted Friedman, one of the top litigators in New York in the 1970s and 1980s. Like
Flom, he grew up poor, the child of struggling Jewish immigrants.
“My options were City College and the University of Michigan,” Friedman said. City College
was free, and Michiganthen, as now, one of the top universities in the United Stateswas $450 a
year. “And the thing was, after the first year, you could get a scholarship if your grades were
high,” Friedman said. “So it was only the first year I had to pay that, if I did well.” Friedman's
first inclination was to stay in New York. “Well, I went to City College for one day, I didn't like
it. I thought, This is going to be four more years of Bronx Science [the high school he had
attended], and came home, packed my bags, and hitch hiked to Ann Arbor.” He went on:
I had a couple of hundred dollars in my pocket from the summer. I was working the Catskills to
make enough money to pay the four-hundred-fifty-dollar tuition, and I had some left over. Then
there was this fancy restaurant in Ann Arbor where I got a job waiting tables. I also worked the
night shift at River Rouge, the big Ford plant. That was real money. It wasn't so hard to get that
job. The factories were looking for people. I had another job too, which paid me the best pay I
ever had before I became a lawyer, which was working in construction. During the summer, in
Ann Arbor, we built the Chrysler proving grounds. I worked there a few summers during law
school. Those jobs were really high paying, probably because you worked so much overtime.
Think about this story for a moment. The first lesson is that Friedman was willing to work hard,
take responsibility for himself, and put himself through school. But the second, perhaps more
important lesson is that he happened to come along at a time in America when if you were willing to work hard, you could take
responsibility for yourself and put yourself through school. Friedman was, at the time, what we
would today call “economically disadvantaged.” He was an inner-city kid from the Bronx, neither
of whose parents went to college. But look at how easy it was for him to get a good education.
He graduated from his public high school in New York at a time when New York City public
schools were the envy of the world. His first option, City College, was free, and his second
option, the University of Michigan, cost just $450and the admissions process was casual
enough, apparently, that he could try one school one day and the other the next.
And how did he get thereHe hitchhiked, with the money that he made in the summer in his
pocket, and when he arrived, he immediately got a series of really good jobs to help pay his
way, because the factories were “looking for people.” And of course they were: they had to
feed the needs of the big generation just ahead of those born in the demographic trough of the
1930s, and the big generation of baby boomers coming up behind them. The sense of
possibility so necessary for success comes not just from inside us or from our parents. It comes
from our time: from the particular opportunities that our particular place in history presents us
with. For a young wouldbe lawyer, being born in the early 1930s was a magic time, just as being
born in 1955 was for a software programmer, or being born in 1835 was for an entrepreneur.
Page 58/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Today, Mort Janklow has an office high above Park Avenue filled with gorgeous works of
modern arta Dubuffet, an Anselm Kiefer. He tells hilarious stories.
(“My mother had two sisters. One lived to be ninetynine and the other died at ninety. The
ninety-nine-yearold was a smart woman. She married my Uncle Al, who was the chief of sales
for Maidenform. Once I said to him, 'What's the rest of the country like, Uncle Al?' And he said,
'Kiddo. When you leave New York, every place is Bridgeport.' ”) He gives the sense that the
world is his for the taking. “I've always been a big risk taker,” he says. “When I built the cable
company, in the early stages, I was making deals where I would have been bankrupt if I hadn't
pulled it off. I had confidence that I could make it work.”
Mort Janklow went to New York City public schools when they were at their best. Maurice
Janklow went to New York City public schools when they were at their most overcrowded. Mort
Janklow went to Columbia University Law School, because demographic trough babies have
their pick of selective schools. Maurice Janklow went to Brooklyn Law School, which was as
good as an immigrant child could do in 1919. Mort Janklow sold his cable business for tens of
millions of dollars. Maurice Janklow closed titles for twenty-five dollars. The story of the
Janklows tells us that the meteoric rise of Joe Flom could not have happened at just any time.
Even the most gifted of lawyers, equipped with the best of family lessons, cannot escape the
limitations of their generation.
“My mother was coherent until the last five or six months of her life,” MortJanklow said. “And
in her delirium she talked about things that she'd never talked about before. She shed tears over
her friends dying in the 1918 flu epidemic. That generationmy parents' generationlived through
a lot. They lived through that epidemic, which took, whatten percent of the world's population.
Panic in the streets. Friends dying. And then the First World War, then the Depression, then the
Second World War. They didn't have much of a chance. That was a very tough period. My
father would have been much more successful in a different kind of world.”
Lesson Number Three:The Garment Industry and Meaningful Work
8.
In 1889, Louis and Regina Borgenicht boarded an ocean liner in Hamburg bound for America.
Louis was from Galacia, in what was then Poland. Regina was from a small town in Hungary.
They had been married only a few years and had one small child and a second on the way. For
the thirteen-day journey, they slept on straw mattresses on a deck above the engine room,
hanging tight to their bunk beds as the ship pitched and rolled. They knew one person in New
York: Borgenicht's sister, Sallie, who had immigrated ten years before. They had enough
money to last a few weeks, at best. Like so many other immigrants to America in those years,
theirs was a leap of faith.
Louis and Regina found a tiny apartment on Eldridge Street, on Manhattan's Lower East Side,
for $8 a month. Louis then took to the streets, looking for work. He saw peddlers and fruit
sellers and sidewalks crammed with pushcarts. The noise and activity and energy dwarfed what
he had known in the Old World. He was first overwhelmed, then invigorated. He went to his
sister's fish store on Ludlow Street and persuaded her to give him a consignment of herring on
credit. He set up shop on the sidewalk with two barrels of fish, hopping back and forth between
Page 59/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
them and chanting in German:
For frying For baking For cooking Good also for eating Herring will do for every meal, And for
every class!
By the end of the week, he had cleared $8. By the second week, $13. Those were considerable
sums. But Louis and Regina could not see how selling herring on the street would lead to a
constructive business. Louis then decided to try being a pushcart peddler. He sold towels and
tablecloths, without much luck. He switched to notebooks, then bananas, then socks and
stockings. Was there really a future in pushcarts Regina gave birth to a second child, a daughter,
and Louis's urgency grew. He now had four mouths to feed.
The answer came to him after five long days of walking up and down the streets of the Lower
East Side, just as he was about to give up hope. He was sitting on an overturned box, eating a
late lunch of the sandwiches Regina had made for him. It was clothes. Everywhere around him
stores were openingsuits, dresses, overalls, shirts, skirts, blouses, trousers, all made and ready to
be worn.
Coming from a world where clothing was sewn at home by hand or made to order by tailors,
this was a revelation. “To me the greatest wonder in this was not the mere quantity of
garmentsalthough that was a miracle in itself“ Borgenicht would write years later, after he
became a prosperous manufacturer of women's and children's clothing, ”but the fact that in
America even poor people could save all the dreary, time-consuming labor of making their own
clothes simply by going into a store and walking out with what they needed. There was a field to
go into, a field to thrill to.”
Borgenicht took out a small notebook. Everywhere he went, he wrote down what people were
wearing and what was for salemenswear, women's wear, children's wear. He wanted to find a
“novel” item, something that people would wear that was not being sold in the stores. For four
more days he walked the streets. On the evening of the final day as he walked toward home, he
saw a half dozen girls playing hopscotch. One of the girls was wearing a tiny embroidered apron
over her dress, cut low in the front with a tie in the back, and it struck him, suddenly, that in his
previous days of relentlessly inventorying the clothing shops of the Lower East Side, he had
never seen one of those aprons for sale.
He came home and told Regina. She had an ancient sewing machine that they had bought upon
their arrival in America. The next morning, he went to a dry-goods store on Hester Street and
bought a hundred yards of gingham and fifty yards of white crossbar. He came back to their tiny
apartment and laid the goods out on the dining room table. Regina began to cut the
ginghamsmall sizes for toddlers, larger for small childrenuntil she had forty aprons. She began to
sew. At midnight, she went to bed and Louis took up where she had left off. At dawn, she rose
and began cutting buttonholes and adding buttons. By ten in the morning, the aprons were
finished. Louis gathered them up over his arm and ventured out onto Hester Street.
“Children's aprons! Little girls' aprons! Colored ones, ten cents. White ones, fifteen cents! Little
girls' aprons!”
By one o'clock, all forty were gone.
Page 60/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
“Ma, we've got our business,” he shouted out to Regina, after running all the way home from
Hester Street.
He grabbed her by the waist and began swinging her around and around.
“You've got to help me,” he cried out. “We'll work together! Ma, this is our business”

Jewish immigrants like the Floms and the Borgenichts and the Janklows were not like the other
immigrants who came to America in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Irish and
the Italians were peasants, tenant farmers from the impoverished countryside of Europe. Not so
the Jews. For centuries in Europe, they had been forbidden to own land, so they had clustered
in cities and towns, taking up urban trades and professions. Seventy percent of the Eastern
European Jews who came through Ellis Island in the thirty years or so before the First World
War had some kind of occupational skill. They had owned small groceries or jewelry stores.
They had been bookbinders or watchmakers. Overwhelmingly, though, their experience lay in
the clothing trade. They were tailors and dressmakers, hat and cap makers, and furriers and
tanners.
Louis Borgenicht, for example, left the impoverished home of his parents at age twelve to work
as a salesclerk in a general store in the Polish town of Brzesko. When the opportunity came to
work in Schnittwaren Handlung (literally, the handling of cloth and fabrics or “piece goods,” as
they were known), he jumped at it. “In those days, the piece-goods man was clothier to the
world,” he writes, “and of the three fundamentals required for life in that simple society, food
and shelter were humble. Clothing was the aristocrat. Practitioners of the clothing art, dealers in
wonderful cloths from every corner of Europe, traders who visited the centers of industry on
their annual buying toursthese were the merchant princes of my youth. Their voices were heard,
their weight felt.”
Borgenicht worked in piece goods for a man named Epstein, then moved on to a store in
neighboring Jaslow called Brandstatter's. It was there that the young Borgenicht learned the ins
and outs of all the dozens of different varieties of cloth, to the point where he could run his hand
over a fabric and tell you the thread count, the name of the manufacturer, and its place of
origin. A few years later, Borgenicht moved to Hungary and met Regina. She had been running
a dressmaking business since the age of sixteen. Together they opened a series of small
piecegoods stores, painstakingly learning the details of smallbusiness entrepreneurship.
Borgenicht's great brainstorm that day on the upturned box on Hester Street, then, did not
come from nowhere. He was a veteran of Schnittwaren Handlung, and his wife was a seasoned
dressmaker. This was their field. And at the same time as the Borgenichts set up shop inside
their tiny apartment, thousands of other Jewish immigrants were doing the same thing, putting
their sewing and dressmaking and tailoring skills to use, to the point where by 1900, control of
the garment industry had passed almost entirely into the hands of the Eastern European
newcomers. As Borgenicht puts it, the Jews "bit deep into the welcoming land and worked like
madmen at what they knew.30 Today, at a time when New York is at the center of an
enormous and diversified metropolitan area, it is easy to forget the significance of the set of
skills that immi grants like the Borgenichts brought to the New World. From the late nineteenth
Page 61/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
century through the middle of the twentieth century, the garment trade was the largest and most
economically vibrant industry in the city. More people worked making clothes in New York than
at anything else, and more clothes were manufactured in New York than in any other city in the
world. The distinctive buildings that still stand on the lower half of Broadway in Manhattanfrom
the big tenand fifteen-story industrial warehouses in the twenty blocks below Times Square to
the cast-iron lofts of S0H0 and Tribecawere almost all built to house coat makers and hatmakers
and lingerie man ufacturers and huge rooms of men and women hunched over sewing
machines. To come to New York City in the 1890s with a background in dressmaking or sewing
or Schnittwaren Handlung was a stroke of extraordinary good fortune. It was like showing up in
Silicon Valley in 1986 with ten thousand hours of computer programming already under your
belt.
“There is no doubt that those Jewish immigrants arrived at the perfect time, with the perfect
skills,” says the sociologist Stephen Steinberg. “T o exploit that opportunity, you had to have
certain virtues, and those immigrants worked hard. They sacrificed. They scrimped and saved
and invested wisely. But still, you have to remember that the garment industry in those years
was growing by leaps and bounds. The economy was desperate for the skills that they
possessed.”
Louis and Regina Borgenicht and the thousands of others who came over on the boats with
them were given a golden opportunity. And so were their children and grandchildren, because
the lessons those garment workers brought home with them in the evenings turned out to be
critical for getting ahead in the world.
10.
The day after Louis and Regina Borgenicht sold out their first lot of forty aprons, Louis made his
way to H. B. Claflin and Company. Claflin was a dry-goods “commission” house, the equivalent
of Brandstatter's back in Poland. There, Borgenicht asked for a salesman who spoke German,
since his English was almost nonexistent. He had in his hand his and Regina's life
savings$125and with that money, he bought enough cloth to make ten dozen aprons. Day and
night, he and Regina cut and sewed. He sold all ten dozen in two days. Back he went to Claflin
for another round. They sold those too. Before long, he and Regina hired another immigrant
just off the boat to help with the children so Regina could sew full-time, and then another to
serve as an apprentice. Louis ventured uptown as far as Harlem, selling to the mothers in the
tenements. He rented a storefront on Sheriff Street, with living quarters in the back. He hired
three more girls, and bought sewing machines for all of them. He became known as “the apron
man.” He and Regina were selling aprons as fast as they could make them.
Before long, the Borgenichts decided to branch out. They started making adult aprons, then
petticoats, then women's dresses. By January of 1892, the Borgenichts had twenty people
working for them, mostly immigrant Jews like themselves. They had their own factory on the
Lower East Side of Manhattan and a growing list of customers, including a store uptown owned
by another Jewish immigrant family, the Bloomingdale brothers. Keep in mind the Borgenichts
had been in the country for only three years at this point. They barely spoke English. And they
weren't rich yet by any stretch of the imagination. Whatever profit they made got plowed back
into their business, and Borgenicht says he had only $200 in the bank. But already he was in
charge of his own destiny.
Page 62/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
This was the second great advantage of the garment industry. It wasn't just that it was growing
by leaps and bounds. It was also explicitly entrepreneurial. Clothes weren't made in a single big
factory. Instead, a number of established firms designed patterns and prepared the fabric, and
then the complicated stitching and pressing and button attaching were all sent out to small
contractors. And if a contractor got big enough, or ambitious enough, he started designing his
own patterns and preparing his own fabric. By 1913, there were approximately sixteen
thousand separate companies in New York City's garment business, many just like the
Borgenichts' shop on Sheriff Street.
“The threshold for getting involved in the business was very low. It's basically a business built on
the sewing machine, and sewing machines don't cost that much,” says Daniel Soyer, a historian
who has written widely on the garment industry. “So you didn't need a lot of capital. At the turn
of the twentieth century, it was probably fifty dollars to buy a machine or two. All you had to do
to be a contractor was to have a couple sewing machines, some irons, and a couple of workers.
The profit margins were very low but you could make some money.”
Listen to how Borgenicht describes his decision to expand beyond aprons:
From my study of the market I knew that only three men were making children's dresses in
1890. One was an East Side tailor near me, who made only to order, while the other two
turned out an expensive product with which I had no desire at all to compete. I wanted to make
“popular price” stuffwash dresses, silks, and woolens. It was my goal to produce dresses that the
great mass of the people could afford, dresses that wouldfrom the business anglesell equally well
to both large and small, city and country stores. With Regina's helpshe always had excellent
taste, and judgmentI made up a line of samples. Displaying them to all my “old” customers and
friends, I hammered home every pointmy dresses would save mothers endless work, the
materials and sewing were as good and probably better than anything that could be done at
home, the price was right for quick disposal.
On one occasion, Borgenicht realized that his only chance to undercut bigger firms was to
convince the wholesalers to sell cloth to him directly, eliminating the middleman. He went to
see a Mr. Bingham at Lawrence and Company, a “tall, gaunt, white-bearded Yankee with steelblue eyes.” There the two of them were, the immigrant from rural Poland, his eyes ringed with
fatigue, facing off in his halting English against the imperious Yankee. Borgenicht said he
wanted to buy forty cases of cashmere. Bingham had never before sold to an individual
company, let alone a shoestring operation on Sheriff Street.
“You have a hell of a cheek coming in here and asking me for favors!” Bingham thundered. But
he ended up saying yes.
What Borgenicht was getting in his eighteen-hour days was a lesson in the modern economy.
He was learning market research. He was learning manufacturing. He was learning how to
negotiate with imperious Yankees. He was learning how to plug himself into popular culture in
order to understand new fashion trends.
The Irish and Italian immigrants who came to New York in the same period didn't have that
advantage. They didn't have a skill specifie to the urban economy. They went to work as day
laborers and domestics and construction workersjobs where you could show up for work every
Page 63/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
day for thirty years and never learn market research and manufacturing and how to navigate the
popular culture and how to negotiate with the Yankees, who ran the world.
Or consider the fate of the Mexicans who immigrated to California between 1900 and the end
of the 1920s to work in the fields of the big fruit and vegetable growers. They simply exchanged
the life of a feudal peasant in Mexico for the life of a feudal peasant in California. “The
conditions in the garment industry were every bit as bad,” Soyer goes on. “But as a garment
worker, you were closer to the center of the industry. If you are working in a field in California,
you have no clue what's happening to the produce when it gets on the truck. If you are working
in a small garment shop, your wages are low, and your conditions are terrible, and your hours
are long, but you can see exactly what the successful people are doing, and you can see how
you can set up your own job.”“”
When Borgenicht came home at night to his children, he may have been tired and poor and
overwhelmed, but he was alive. He was his own boss. He was responsible for his own decisions
and direction. His work was complex: it engaged his mind and imagination. And in his work,
there was a relationship between effort and reward: the longer he and Regina stayed up at night
sewing aprons, the more money they made the next day on the streets.
Those three things autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and rewardare,
most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying. It is not how
much money we make * I realize that it seems strange to refer to American Jewish immigrants
as lucky when the families and relatives they left behind in Europe were on the verge of
extermination at the hands of the Nazis. Borgenicht, in fact, unwittingly captures this poignancy
in his memoir, which was published in 1942. He called it The Happiest Man. After numerous
chapters brimming with optimism and cheer, the book ends with the sobering reality of Nazidominated Europe. Had The Happiest Man been published in 1945, when the full story of the
Holocaust was known, one imagines it would have had a very different title.
that ultimately makes us happy between nine and five. It's whether our work fulfills us. If I
offered you a choice between being an architect for $75,000 a year and working in a tollbooth
every day for the rest of your life for $100,000 a year, which would you takeFm guessing the
former, because there is complexity, autonomy, and a relationship between effort and reward in
doing creative work, and that's worth more to most of us than money.
Work that fulfills those three criteria is meaningful. Being a teacher is meaningful. Being a
physician is meaningful. So is being an entrepreneur, and the miracle of the garment industryas
cutthroat and grim as it waswas that it allowed people like the Borgenichts, just off the boat, to
find something meaningful to do as well.“” When Louis Borgenicht came home after first seeing
that child's apron, he danced a jig. He hadn't sold anything yet. He was still penniless and
desperate, and he knew that to make something of his idea was going to require years of
backbreaking labor. But he was ecstatic, because the prospect of those endless years of hard
labor did not seem like a burden to him. Bill Gates had that same feeling when he first sat down
at the keyboard at Lakeside. And the Beatles didn't recoil in horror when they were told they
had to play eight hours a night, seven days a week. They jumped at the chance. Hard work is a
prison sentence only if it does not have meaning. Once it does, it becomes the kind of thing that
makes you grab your wife around the waist and dance a jig.
Page 64/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
* Just to be clear: to say that garment work was meaningful is not to romanticize it. It was
incredibly hard and often miserable labor. The The most important consequence of the miracle
of the garment industry, though, was what happened to the children growing up in those homes
where meaningful work was practiced. Imagine what it must have been like to watch the
meteoric rise of Regina and Louis Borgenicht through the eyes of one of their offspring. They
learned the same lesson that little Alex W illiams would learn nearly a century latera lesson
crucial to those who wanted to tackle the upper reaches of a profession like law or medicine: if
you work hard enough and assert yourself, and use your mind and imagination, you can shape
the world to your desires.

In 1982, a sociology graduate student named Louise Farkas went to visit a number of nursing
homes and residential hotels in New York City and Miami Beach. She was looking for people
like the Borgenichts, or, more precisely, the children of people like the Borgenichts, who had
come to New York in the great wave of Jewish immigration at the turn of the last century. And
for each of the people she interviewed, she constructed a family tree showing what conditions
were inhuman. One survey in the 1 8 9 0 s put the average workweek at eighty-four hours,
which comes to twelve hours a day. At times, it was higher. “During the busy season,” David
Von Drehle writes in Triangle: The Fire That Changed Amierca, “it was not unusual to find
workers on stools or broken chairs, bent over their sewing or hot irons, from 5 A.M. to 9 P.M.,
a hundred or more hours a week. Indeed, it was said that during the busy seasons the grinding
hum of sewing machines never entirely ceased on the Lower East Side, day or night.”
Mi a line of parents and children and grandchildren and, in some cases, great-grandchildren did
for a living.
Here is her account of “subject #18”:
A Russian tailor artisan comes to America, takes to the needle trade, works in a sweat shop for
a small salary. Later takes garments to finish at home with the help of his wife and older
children. In order to increase his salary he works through the night. Later he makes a garment
and sells it on New York streets. He accumulates some capital and goes into a business venture
with his sons. They open a shop to create men's garments. The Russian tailor and his sons
become men's suit manufacturers supplying several men's stores The sons and the father
become prosperous The sons' children become educated professionals.

another. It's a tanner who emigrated from Poland in the late nineteenth century.

Doctor Lawyer Lawyer Lawyer 152 Farkas's Jewish family trees go on for pages, each virtually
identical to the one before, until the conclusion becomes inescapable: Jewish doctors and
lawyers did not become professionals in spite of their humble origins. They became
professionals because of their humble origins.
Ted Friedman, the prominent litigator in the 1970s and 1980s, remembers as a child going to
concerts with his mother at Carnegie Hall. They were poor and living in the farthest corners of
the Bronx. How did they afford tickets“Mary got a quarter,” Friedman says. “There was a Mary
Page 65/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
who was a ticket taker, and if you gave Mary a quarter, she would let you stand in the second
balcony, without a ticket. Carnegie Hall didn't know about it. It was just between you and Mary.
It was a bit of a journey, but we would go back once or twice a month.”“”
Friedman's mother was a Russian immigrant. She barely spoke English. But she had gone to
work as a seamstress at the age of fifteen and had become a prominent garment union
organizer, and what you learn in that world is that through your own powers of persuasion and
initiative, you can take your kids to Carnegie Hall. There is no better lesson for a budding lawyer
than that. The garment industry was boot camp for the professions.
* The conventional explanation for Jewish success, of course, is that Jews come from a literate,
intellectual culture. They are famously “the people of the book.” There is surely something to
that. But it wasn't just the children of rabbis who went to law school. It was the children of
garment workers. And their critical advantage in climbing the professional ladder wasn't the
intellectual rigor you get from studying the Talmud. It was the practical intelligence and savvy
you get from watching your father sell aprons on Hester Street.
What did Joe Flom's father doHe sewed shoulder pads for women's dresses. What did Robert
Oppenheimer's father doHe was a garment manufacturer, like Louis Borgenicht. One flight up
from Flom's corner office at Skadden, Arps is the office of Barry Garfinkel, who has been at
Skadden, Arps nearly as long as Flom and who for many years headed the firm's litigation
department. What did Garfinkel's mother doShe was a milliner. She made hats at home. What
did two of Louis and Regina Borgenicht's sons doThey went to law school, and no less than nine
of their grandchildren ended up as doctors and lawyers as well.
Here is the most remarkable of Farkas's family trees. It belongs to a Jewish family from
Romania who had a small grocery store in the Old Country and then came to New York and
opened another, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It is the most elegant answer to the
question of where all the Joe Floms came from.

12.
Ten blocks north of the Skadden, Arps headquarters in midtown Manhattan are the offices of
Joe Flom's great rival, the law firm generally regarded as the finest in the world.
It is headquartered in the prestigious office building known as Black Rock. To get hired there
takes a small miracle. Unlike New York's other major law firms, all of which have hundreds of
attorneys scattered around the major capitals of the world, it operates only out of that single
Manhattan building. It turns down much more business than it accepts. Unlike every one of its
competitors, it does not bill by the hour. It simply names a fee. Once, while defending Kmart
against a takeover, the firm billed $20 million for two weeks' work. Kmart paidhappily. If its
attorneys do not outsmart you, they will outwork you, and if they can't outwork you, they'll win
through sheer intimidation. There is no firm in the world that has made more money, lawyer for
lawyer, over the past two decades. On Joe Flom's wall, next to pictures of Flom with George
Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton, there is a picture of him with the rival firm's managing partner.
Page 66/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
No one rises to the top of the New York legal profession unless he or she is smart and
ambitious and hardworking, and clearly the four men who founded the Black Rock firm fit that
description. But we know far more than that, don't weSuccess is not a random act. It arises out
of a predictable and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities, and at this point, after
examining the lives of Bill Joy and Bill Gates, pro hockey players and geniuses, and Joe Flom,
the Janklows, and the Borgenichts, it shouldn't be hard to figure out where the perfect lawyer
comes from.
This person will have been born in a demographic trough, so as to have had the best of New
York's public schools and the easiest time in the job market. He will be Jewish, of course, and
so, locked out of the old-line downtown law firms on account of his “antecedents.” This person's
parents will have done meaningful work in the garment business, passing on to their children
autonomy and complexity and the connection between effort and reward. A good
schoolalthough it doesn't have to be a great schoolwill have been attended. He need not have
been the smartest in the class, only smart enough.
In fact, we can be even more precise. Just as there is a perfect birth date for a nineteenthcentury business tycoon, and a perfect birth date for a software tycoon, there is a perfect birth
date for a New York Jewish lawyer as well. It's 1930, because that would give the lawyer the
benefit of a blessedly small generation. It would also make him forty years of age in 1970, when
the revolution in the legal world first began, which translates to a healthy fifteen-year Hamburg
period in the takeover business while the white-shoe lawyers lingered, oblivious, over their twomartini lunches. If you want to be a great New York lawyer, it is an advantage to be an outsider,
and it is an advantage to have parents who did meaningful work, and, better still, it is an
advantage to have been born in the early 1930s. But if you have all three advantageson top of a
good dose of ingenuity and drivethen that's an unstoppable combination. That's like being a
hockey player born on January 1.
The Black Rock law firm is W achtell, Lipton, Rosen 8t Katz. The firm's first partner was
Herbert Wachtell. He was born in 1931. He grew up in the Amalgamated Clothing Workers
union housing across from Van Cortlandt Park, in the Bronx. His parents were Jewish
immigrants from the Ukraine. His father was in the ladies' undergarment business with his
brothers, on the sixth floor of what is now a fancy loft at Broadway and Spring Street in SoHo.
He went to New York City public schools in the 1940s, then to City College in upper
Manhattan, and then to New York University Law School.
The second partner was Martin Lipton. He was born in 1931. His father was a manager at a
factory. He was a descendant of Jewish immigrants. He attended public schools in Jersey City,
then the University of Pennsylvania, then New York University Law School.
The third partner was Leonard Rosen. He was born in 1930. He grew up poor in the Bronx,
near Yankee Stadium. His parents were Jewish immigrants from the Ukraine. His father worked
in the garment district in Manhattan as a presser. He went to New York City public schools in
the 1940s, then to City College in upper Manhattan, and then to New York University Law
School. The fourth partner was George Katz. He was born in 1931. He grew up in a onebedroom first-floor apartment in the Bronx. His parents were the children of Jewish immigrants
from Eastern Europe. His father sold insurance. His grandfather, who lived a few blocks away,
was a sewer in the garment trade, doing piecework out of his house. He went to New York City

public schools in the 1940s, then to City College in upper Manhattan, and then to New York
University Law School.
Imagine that we had met any one of these four fresh out of law school, sitting in the elegant
waiting room at Mudge Rose next to a blue-eyed Nordic type from the “right”
background. W e'd all have bet on the Nordic type. And we would have been wrong, because
the Katzes and the Rosens and the Liptons and the Wachtells and the Floms had something that
the Nordic type did not. Their worldtheir culture and generation and family historygave them the
greatest of opportunities.

CHAPTER SIX
Harlan, Kentucky “DIE LIKE A MAN, LIKE YOUR BROTHER DID!”
1.
In the southeastern corner of Kentucky, in the stretch of the Appalachian Mountains known as
the Cumberland Plateau, lies a small town called Harlan.
The Cumberland Plateau is a wild and mountainous region of flat-topped ridges, mountain walls
five hundred to a thousand feet high, and narrow valleys, some wide enough only for a one-lane
road and a creek. When the area was first settled, the plateau was covered with a dense
primeval forest. Giant tulip poplars grew in the coves and at the foot of the hills, some with
trunks as wide as seven or eight feet in diameter. Alongside them were white oaks, beeches,
maples, walnuts, sycamores, birches, willows, cedars, pines, and hemlocks, all enmeshed in a
lattice of wild grapevine, comprising one of the greatest assortment of forest trees in the
Northern Hemisphere. On the ground were bears and mountain lions and rattlesnakes; in the
treetops, an astonishing array of squirrels; and beneath the soil, one thick seam after another of
coal.
Harlan County was founded in 1819 by eight immigrant families from the northern regions of
the British Isles. They had come to Virginia in the eighteenth century and then moved west into
the Appalachians in search of land. The county was never wealthy. For its first one hundred
years, it was thinly populated, rarely numbering more than ten thousand people. The first
settlers kept pigs and herded sheep on the hillsides, scratching out a living on small farms in the
valleys. They made whiskey in backyard stills and felled trees, floating them down the
Cumberland River in the spring, when the water was high. Until well into the twentieth century,
getting to the nearest train station was a two-day wagon trip. The only way out of town was up
Pine Mountain, which was nine steep miles on a road that turned on occasion into no more than
a muddy, rocky trail. Harlan was a remote and strange place, unknown by the larger society
around it, and it might well have remained so but for the fact that two of the town's founding
familiesthe Howards and the Turnersdid not get along.
The patriarch of the Howard clan was Samuel Howard. He built the town courthouse and the
jail. His counterpart was William Turner, who owned a tavern and two general stores. Once a
storm blew down the fence to the Turner property, and a neighbor's cow wandered onto their
land. William Turner's grandson, “Devil Jim,” shot the cow dead. The neighbor was too terrified
to press charges and fled the county. Another time, a man tried to open a competitor to the
Turners' general store. The Turners had a word with him. He closed the store and moved to
Indiana. These were not pleasant people.
One night Wix Howard and “Little Bob” Turnerthe grandsons of Samuel and William,
respectivelyplayed against each other in a game of poker. Each accused the other of cheating.
They fought. The following day they met in the street, and after a flurry of gunshots, Little Bob
Turner lay dead with a shotgun blast to the chest. A group of Turners went to the Howards'
Page 69/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
general store and spoke roughly to Mrs. Howard. She was insulted and told her son Wilse
Howard, and the following week he exchanged gunfire with another of Turner's grandsons,
young Will Turner, on the road to Hagan, Virginia. That night one of the Turners and a friend
attacked the Howard home. The two families then clashed outside the Harlan courthouse. In the
gunfire, Will Turner was shot and killed. A contingent of Howards then went to see Mrs. Turner,
the mother of Will Turner and Little Bob, to ask for a truce. She declined: “You can't wipe out
that blood,” she said, pointing to the dirt where her son had died.
Things quickly went from bad to worse. Wilse Howard ran into “Little George” Turner near
Sulphur Springs and shot him dead. The Howards ambushed three friends of the Turnersthe
Cawoodskilling all of them. A posse was sent out in search of the Howards. In the resulting
gunfight, six more were killed or wounded. Wilse Howard heard the Turners were after him,
and he and a friend rode into Harlan and attacked the Turner home. Riding back, the Howards
were ambushed. In the fighting, another person died. Wilse Howard rode to Little George
Turner's house and fired at him but missed and killed another man. A posse surrounded the
Howard home. There was another gunfight. More dead. The county was in an uproar. I think
you get the picture. There were places in nineteenthcentury America where people lived in
harmony. Harlan, Kentucky, was not one of them.
“Stop that!” Will Turner's mother snapped at him when he staggered home, howling in pain
after being shot in the courthouse gun battle with the Howards. “Die like a man, like your
brother did!” She belonged to a world so well acquainted with fatal gunshots that she had certain
expectations about how they ought to be endured. Will shut his mouth, and he died.
2.
Suppose you were sent to Harlan in the late nineteenth century to investigate the causes of the
Howard-Turner feud. You lined up every surviving participant and interviewed them as carefully
as you could. You subpoenaed documents and took depositions and pored over court records
until you had put together a detailed and precise accounting of each stage in the deadly quarrel.
How much would you knowThe answer is, not much. You'd learn that there were two families
in Harlan who didn't much like each other, and you'd confirm that Wilse Howard, who was
responsible for an awful lot of the violence, probably belonged behind bars. What happened in
Harlan wouldn't become clear until you looked at the violence from a much broader perspective.
The first critical fact about Harlan is that at the same time that the Howards and the Turners
were killing one another, there were almost identical clashes in other small towns up and down
the Appalachians. In the famous Hatfield-McCoy feud on the West Virginia-Kentucky border not
far from Harlan, several dozen people were killed in a cycle of violence that stretched over
twenty years. In the French-Eversole feud in Perry County, Kentucky, twelve died, six of them
killed by “Bad Tom” Smith (a man, John Ed Pearce writes in Days of Darkness, who was “just
dumb enough to be fearless, just bright enough to be dangerous, and a dead shot”). The MartinTolliver feud, in Rowan County, Kentucky, in the mid-1880s featured three gunfights, three
ambushes, and two house attacks, and ended in a two-hour gun battle involving one hundred
armed men. The Baker-Howard feud in Clay County, Kentucky, began in 1806, with an elkhunting party gone bad, and didn't end until the 1930s, when a couple of Howards killed three
Bakers in an ambush.
Page 70/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
And these were just the well-known feuds. The Kentucky legislator Harry Caudill once looked in
a circuit court clerk's office in one Cumberland Plateau town and found one thousand murder
indictments stretching from the end of the Civil War, in the 1860s, to the beginning of the
twentieth centuryand this for a region that never numbered more than fifteen thousand people
and where many violent acts never even made it to the indictment stage. Caudill writes of a
murder trial in Breathitt Countyor “Bloody Breathitt,” as it came to be knownthat ended abruptly
when the defendant's father, “a man of about fifty with huge handlebar whiskers and two
immense pistols,” walked up to the judge and grabbed his gavel:
The feudist rapped the bench and announced, “Court's over and ever'body can go. We ain't
agoin' to have any court here this term, folks.” The red-faced judge hastily acquiesced in this
extraordinary order and promptly left town. When court convened at the next term the court
and sheriff were bolstered by sixty militiamen, but by then the defendant was not available for
trial. He had been slain from ambush.
When one family fights with another, it's a feud. When lots of families fight with one another in
identical little towns up and down the same mountain range, it's ^pattern.
What was the cause of the Appalachian patternOver the years, many potential explanations
have been examined and debated, and the consensus appears to be that that region was
plagued by a particularly virulent strain of what sociologists call a “culture of honor.”
Cultures of honor tend to take root in highlands and other marginally fertile areas, such as Sicily
or the mountainous Basque regions of Spain. If you live on some rocky moun tainside, the
explanation goes, you can't farm. You probably raise goats or sheep, and the kind of culture
that grows up around being a herdsman is very different from the culture that grows up around
growing crops. The survival of a farmer depends on the cooperation of others in the
community. But a herdsman is off by himself. Farmers also don't have to worry that their
livelihood will be stolen in the night, because crops can't easily be stolen unless, of course, a
thief wants to go to the trouble of harvesting an entire field on his own. But a herdsman does
have to worry. He's under constant threat of ruin through the loss of his animals. So he has to
be aggressive: he has to make it clear, through his words and deeds,
that he is not weak. He has to be willing to fight in response to even the slightest challenge to
his reputationand that's what a “culture of honor” means. It's a world where a man's reputation
is at the center of his livelihood and self-worth.
“The critical moment in the development of the young shepherd's reputation is his first quarrel,”
the ethnographer J. K. Campbell writes of one herding culture in Greece. “Quarrels are
necessarily public. They may occur in the coffee shop, the village square, or most frequently on
a grazing boundary where a curse or a stone aimed at one of his straying sheep by another
shepherd is an insult which inevitably requires a violent response.”
So why was Appalachia the way it wasIt was because of where the original inhabitants of the
region came from. The so-called American backcountry statesfrom the Pennsylvania border
south and west through Virginia and West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, North Carolina
and South Carolina, and the northern end of Alabama and Georgiawere settled overwhelmingly
by immigrants from one of the world's most ferocious cultures of honor. They were “ScotchPage 71/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Irish”that is, from the lowlands of Scotland, the northern counties of England, and Ulster in
Northern Ireland.
The borderlandsas this region was knownwere remote and lawless territories that had been
fought over for hundreds of years. The people of the region were steeped in violence. They
were herdsmen, scraping out a living on rocky and infertile land. They were clannish,
responding to the harshness and turmoil of their environment by forming tight family bonds and
placing loyalty to blood above all else. And when they immigrated to North America, they
moved into the American interior, to remote, lawless,
rocky, and marginally fertile places like Harlan that allowed them to reproduce in the New
World the culture of honor they had created in the Old World.
“To the first settlers, the American backcountry was a dangerous environment, just as the British
borderlands had been,” the historian David Hackett Fischer writes in Albion's Seed.
Much of the southern highlands were “debatable lands” in the border sense of a contested
territory without established government or the rule of law. The borderers were more at home
than others in this anarchic environment, which was well suited to their family system, their
warrior ethic, their farming and herding economy, their attitudes toward land and wealth and
their ideas of work and power. So well adapted was the border culture to this environment that
other ethnic groups tended to copy it. The ethos of the North British borders came to dominate
this “dark and bloody ground,” partly by force of numbers, but mainly because it was a means of
survival in a raw and dangerous world*
The triumph of a culture of honor helps to explain why the pattern of criminality in the
American South has always been so distinctive. Murder rates are higher there than in the *
David Hackett Fischer's book Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America is the most
definitive and convincing treatment of the idea that cultural legacies cast a long historical
shadow. (If you read my first book, The Tipping Point, you'll remember that the discussion of
Paul Revere was drawn from Fischer's Paul Revere's Ride.) In Albion's Seed, Fischer argues that
there were four distinct British migrations to America in its first 150 years: first the Puritans, in
the 1630s, who came from East Anglia to Massachusetts; then the Cavaliers and indentured rest
of the country. But crimes of property and “stranger” crimeslike muggingsare lower. As the
sociologist John Shelton Reed has written, “The homicides in which the South seems to
specialize are those in which someone is being killed by someone he (or often she) knows, for
reasons both killer and victim understand.” Reed adds: “The statistics show that the Southerner
who can avoid arguments and adultery is as safe as any other American, and probably safer.” In
the backcountry, violence wasn't for economic gain. It was personal. You fought over your
honor.
Many years ago, the southern newspaperman Hodding Carter told the story of how as a young
man he served on a jury. As Reed describes it:
The case before the jury involved an irascible gentleman who lived next door to a filling station.
For several months he had been the butt of various jokes played by the attend ants and the
miscellaneous loafers who hung around the station, despite his warnings and his notorious short
temper. One morning, he emptied both barrels of his shotgun at his tormenters, killing one,
Page 72/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
maiming another permanently, and wounding a third.... When the jury was polled by the
incredulous judge, Carter was the only juror who recorded his vote as guilty. As one of the
others put it, “He wouldn't of been much of a man if he hadn't shot them fellows.”
servants, who came from southern England to Virginia in the midseventeenth century; then the
Quakers, from the North Midlands to the Delaware Valley between the late seventeenth and
early eighteenth centuries; and finally, the people of the borderlands to the Appalachian interior
in the eighteenth century. Fischer argues brilliantly that those four cultureseach profoundly
differentcharacterize those four regions of the United States even to this day.
Only in a culture of honor would it have occurred to the irascible gentleman that shooting
someone was an appropriate response to a personal insult. And only in a culture of honor would
it have occurred to a jury that murderunder those circumstanceswas not a crime.
I realize that we are often wary of making these kinds of broad generalizations about different
cultural groupsand with good reason. This is the form that racial and ethnic stereotypes take. W
e want to believe that we are not prisoners of our ethnic histories.
But the simple truth is that if you want to understand what happened in those small towns in
Kentucky in the nineteenth century, you have to go back into the pastand not just one or two
generations. You have to go back two or three or four hundred years, to a country on the other
side of the ocean, and look closely at what exactly the people in a very specific geographic area
of that country did for a living. The “culture of honor” hypothesis says that it matters where
you're from, not just in terms of where you grew up or where your parents grew up, but in
terms of where your great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents grew up and even where
your great-great-great-grandparents grew up. That is a strange and powerful fact. It's just the
beginning, though, because upon closer examination, cultural legacies turn out to be even
stranger and more powerful than that.
3.
In the early 1990s, two psychologists at the University of MichiganDov Cohen and Richard
Nisbettdecided to conduct an experiment on the culture of honor. They knew that what
happened in places like Harlan in the nineteenth century was, in all likelihood, a product of
patterns laid down in the English borderlands centuries before. But their interest was in the
present day. Was it possible to find remnants of the culture of honor in the modern eraSo they
decided to gather together a group of young men and insult them. “We sat down and tried to
figure out what is the insult that would go to the heart of an eighteen-to-twenty-year-old's brain,”
Cohen says. “It didn't take too long to come up with 'asshole.' ”
The experiment went like this. The social sciences building at the University of Michigan has a
long, narrow hallway in the basement lined with riling cabinets. The young men were called into
a classroom, one by one, and asked to fill out a questionnaire. Then they were told to drop off
the questionnaire at the end of the hallway and return to the classrooma simple, seemingly
innocent academic exercise.
For half the young men, that was it. They were the control group. For the other half, there was
a catch. As they walked down the hallway with their questionnaire, a mana confederate of the
experimenterswalked past them and pulled out a drawer in one of the filing cabinets. The
Page 73/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
already narrow hallway now became even narrower. As the young men tried to squeeze by, the
confederate looked up, annoyed. He slammed the filing cabinet drawer shut, jostled the young
men with his shoulder, and, in a low but audible voice, said the trigger word: “Asshole.”
Cohen and Nisbett wanted to measure, as precisely as possible, what being called that word
meant. They looked at the faces of their subjects and rated how much anger they saw. They
shook the young men's hands to see if their grip was firmer than usual. They took saliva samples
from the students, both before and after the insult, to see if being called an asshole caused their
levels of testosterone and Cortisolthe hormones that drive arousal and aggressionto go up.
Finally they asked the students to read the following story and supply a conclusion:
It had only been about twenty minutes since they had arrived at the party when Jill pulled Steve
aside, obviously bothered about something.
“What's wrong?” asked Steve.
“It's Larry. I mean, he knows that you and I are engaged, but he's already made two passes at
me tonight.” Jill walked back into the crowd, and Steve decided to keep his eye on Larry. Sure
enough, within five minutes,
Larry was reaching over and trying to kiss Jill.
If you've been insulted, are you more likely to imagine Steve doing something violent to Larry?
The results were unequivocal. There were clear differences in how the young men responded to
being called a bad name. For some, the insult changed their behavior. For some it didn't. The
deciding factor in how they reacted wasn't how emotionally secure they were, or whether they
were intellectuals or jocks, or whether they were physically imposing or not. What matteredand I
think you can guess where this is headedwas where they were from. Most of the young men
from the northern part of the United States treated the incident with amusement.
They laughed it off. Their handshakes were unchanged. Their levels of Cortisol actually went
down, as if they were unconsciously trying to defuse their own anger. Only a few of them had
Steve get violent with Larry.
But the southernersOh, my. They were angry. Their Cortisol and testosterone jumped. Their
handshakes got firm. Steve was all over Larry.
“We even played this game of chicken/' Cohen said. ”We sent the students back down the
hallways, and around the corner comes another confederate. The hallway is blocked, so there's
only room for one of them to pass. The guy we used was six three, two hundred fifty pounds.
He used to play college football. He was now working as a bouncer in a college bar. He was
walking down the hall in business modethe way you walk through a bar when you are trying to
break up a fight. The question was: how close do they get to the bouncer before they get out of
the wayAnd believe me, they always get out of the way."
For the northerners, there was almost no effect. They got out of the way five or six feet
beforehand, whether they had been insulted or not. The southerners, by contrast, were
downright deferential in normal circumstances, stepping aside with more than nine feet to go.
But if they had just been insultedLess than two feet. Call a southerner an asshole, and he's
Page 74/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
itching for a fight. What Cohen and Nisbett were seeing in that long hall was the culture of
honor in action: the southerners were reacting like Wix Howard did when Little Bob Turner
accused him of cheating at poker.
4.
That study is strange, isn't itIt's one thing to conclude that groups of people living in
circumstances pretty similar to their ancestors' act a lot like their ancestors. But those
southerners in the hallway study weren't living in circumstances similar to their British ancestors.
They didn't even necessarily have British ancestors. They just happened to have grown up in
the South. None of them were herdsmen. Nor were their parents herdsmen. They were living
in the late twentieth century, not the late nineteenth century. They were students at the
University of Michigan, in one of the northernmost states in America, which meant they were
sufficiently cosmopolitan to travel hundreds of miles from the south to go to college. And none
of that mattered. They still acted like they were living in nineteenth-century Harlan, Kentucky.
“Your median student in those studies comes from a family making over a hundred thousand
dollars, and that's in nineteen ninety dollars,” Cohen says. “The southerners we see this effect
with aren't kids who come from the hills of Appalachia. They are more likely to be the sons of
upper-middle management Coca-Cola executives in Atlanta. And that's the big question. Why
should we get this effect with themWhy should one get it hundreds of years laterWhy are these
suburban-Atlanta kids acting out the ethos of the frontier?”*
* Cohen has done other experiments looking again for evidence of “southernness,” and each
time he finds the same thing. “Once, we bothered students with persistent annoyances,” he
said. "They come Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives.
They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the econom ic and social and
dem o graphic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in
directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.“”
So far in Outliers we've seen that success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages:
when and where you are born, what your parents did for a living, and what into the lab and they
are supposed to draw pictures from their childhood. They are doing this with the confederate,
and he's being a jerk. He does all these things to persistently annoy the subject. He'll wad up his
drawing and throw it at the wastebasket and hit the subject. He'll steal the subject's crayons and
not give them back. He keeps on calling the subject 'Slick,' and he says, 'I'm going to put your
name on your drawing,' and writes 'Slick.' What you find is that northerners tend to give off
displays of anger, up to a certain point, at which point they level off. Southerners are much less
likely to be angry early on. But at some point they catch up to the northerners and shoot past
them. They are more likely to explode, much more volatile, much more explosive.“ * How are
these kinds of attitudes passed down from generation to generationThrough social heritance.
Think of the way accents persist over time. David Hackett Fischer points out that the original
settlers of Appalachia said: ”whar for where, thar for there, hard for hired, critter for creature,
sartin for certain, a-goin for going, hit for it, he-it for hit, far forfire,deef for deaf, pizen for
poison, nekkid for naked, eetch for itch, boosh for bush, wrassle for wrestle, chaw for chew,
poosh for push, shet for shut, ba-it for bat, be-it for be, narrer for narrow, winder for window,
widder for widow, and young-uns for young one." Recognize thatIt's the same way many rural
people in the Appalachians speak today. Whatever mechanism passes on speech patterns
Page 75/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
probably passes on behavioral and emotional patterns as well.
the circumstances of your upbringing were all make a significant difference in how well you do
in the world. The question for the second part of Outliers is whether the traditions and attitudes
we inherit from our forebears can play the same role. Can we learn something about why
people succeed and how to make people better at what they do by taking cultural legacies
seriouslyI think we can.

CHAPTER SEVEN
The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes “CAPTAIN, THE WEATHER RADAR HAS HELPED US
ALOT.”
1.
On the morning of August 5, 1997, the captain of Korean Air flight 801 woke at six. His family
would later tell investigators that he went to the gym for an hour, then came home and studied
the flight plan for that evening's journey to Guam. He napped and ate lunch. At three in the
afternoon, he left for Seoul, departing early enough, his wife said, to continue his preparations
at Kimpo International Airport. He had been a pilot with Korean Air for almost four years after
coming over from the Korean Air Force. He had eighty-nine hundred hours of flight time,
including thirty-two hundred hours of experience in jumbo jets. A few months earlier, he had
been given a flight safety award by his airline for successfully handling a jumbo-jet engine failure
at low altitude. He was forty-two years old and in excellent health, with the exception of a bout
of bronchitis that had been diagnosed ten days before.
At seven p.m., the captain, his first officer, and the flight engineer met and collected the trip's
paperwork. They would be flying a Boeing 747the model known in the aviation world as the
“classic.” The aircraft was in perfect working order. It had once been the Korean presidential
plane. Flight 801 departed the gate at ten-thirty in the evening and was airborne twenty minutes
later. Takeoff was without incident. Just before one-thirty in the morning, the plane broke out of
the clouds, and the flight crew glimpsed lights off in the distance.
“Is it Guam?” the flight engineer asked. Then, after a pause, he said, “It's Guam, Guam.”
The captain chuckled. “Good!”
The first officer reported to A ir Traffic Control (A TC) that the airplane was “clear of Charlie
Bravo [cumulonimbus clouds]” and requested “radar vectors for runway six left.”
The plane began its descent toward Guam airport. They would make a visual approach, the
captain said. He had flown into Guam airport from Kimpo eight times previously, most recently
a month ago, and he knew the airport and the surrounding terrain well. The landing gear went
down. The flaps were extended ten degrees. At 01:41 and 48 seconds, the captain said, “W
iper on,” and the flight engineer turned them on. It was raining. The first officer then said, “Not
in sight?” He was looking for the runway. He couldn't see it. One second later, the Ground
Proximity Warning System called out in its electronic voice: “Five hundred [feet].” The plane
was five hundred feet off the ground. But how could that be if they couldn't see the runwayTwo
seconds passed. The flight engineer said, “Eh?” in an astonished tone of voice.
At 01:42 and 19 seconds, the first officer said, “Let's make a missed approach,” meaning, Let's
pull up and make a large circle and try the landing again.
One second later, the flight engineer said, “Not in sight.” The first officer added, “Not in sight,
Page 77/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
missed approach.”
A t 01:42 and 22 seconds, the flight engineer said again, “Go around.”
At 01:42 and 23 seconds, the captain repeated, “Go around,” but he was slow to pull the plane
out of its descent. At 01:42 and 26 seconds, the plane hit the side of Nimitz Hill, a densely
vegetated mountain three miles southwest of the airport $60 million and 212,000 kilograms of
steel slamming into rocky ground at one hundred miles per hour. The plane skidded for two
thousand feet, severing an oil pipeline and snapping pine trees, before falling into a ravine and
bursting into flames. By the time rescue workers reached the crash site, 228 of the 254 people
on board were dead.
2.
Twenty years before the crash of K A L 801, a Korean Air Boeing 707 wandered into Russian
airspace and was shot down by a Soviet military jet over the Barents Sea. It was an accident,
meaning the kind of rare and catastrophic event that, but for the grace of God, could happen to
any airline. It was investigated and analyzed. Lessons were learned. Reports were filed.
l79 Then, two years later, a Korean Air Boeing 747 crashed in Seoul. Two accidents in two
years is not a good sign. Three years after that, the airline lost another 747near Sakhalin Island,
in Russia, followed by a Boeing 707 that went down over the Andaman Sea in 1987, two more
crashes in 1989 in Tripoli and Seoul, and then another in 1994 in Cheju, South Korea.*
To put that record in perspective, the “loss” rate for an airline like the American carrier United
Airlines in the period 1988 to 1998 was .27 per million departures, which means that they lost
a plane in an accident about once in every four million flights. The loss rate for Korean Air, in
the same period, was 4.79 per million departures more than seventeen times higher.
Korean Air's planes were crashing so often that when the National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB)the US agency responsible for investigating plane crashes within American jurisdictiondid
its report on the Guam crash, it was forced to include an addendum listing all the new Korean A
ir accidents that had happened just since its investigation began: the Korean Air 747 that crashlanded at Kimpo in Seoul, almost a year to the day after Guam; the jetliner that overran a
runway at Korea's Ulsan Airport eight weeks after that; the Korean Air McDonnell Douglas 83
that rammed into an embankment at Pohang Airport the following March; and then, a month
after * Korean Air was called Korean Airlines before it changed its name after the Guam
accident. And the Barents Sea incident was actually preceded by two other crashes, in 1971
and 1976.
that, the Korean Air passenger jet that crashed in a residential area of Shanghai. Had the NTSB
waited just a few more months, it could have added another: the Korean Air cargo plane that
crashed just after takeoff from London's Stansted airport, despite the fact that a warning bell
went off in the cockpit no fewer than fourteen times.
In April 1999, Delta Air Lines and Air France suspended their flying partnership with Korean
Air. In short order, the US Army, which maintains thousands of troops in South Korea, forbade
its personnel from flying with the airline. South Korea's safety rating was downgraded by the US
Federal Aviation Authority, and Canadian officials informed Korean Air's management that they
Page 78/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
were considering revoking the company's overflight and landing privileges in Canadian airspace.
In the midst of the controversy, an outside audit of Korean Air's operations was leaked to the
public. The forty-page report was quickly denounced by Korean Air officials as sensationalized
and unrepresentative, but by that point, it was too late to save the company's reputation. The
audit detailed instances of flight crews smoking cigarettes on the tarmac during refueling and in
the freight area; and when the plane was in the air. “Crew read newspapers throughout the
flight,” the audit stated, “often with newspapers held up in such a way that if a warning light
came on, it would not be noticed.” The report detailed bad morale, numerous procedural
violations, and the alarming conclusion that training standards for the 747 “classic” were so poor
that “there is some concern as to whether First Officers on the Classic fleet could land the
aircraft if the Captain became totally incapacitated.”
By the time of the Shanghai crash, the Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, felt compelled to speak
up. “The issue of Korean A ir is not a matter of an individual company but a matter of the whole
country,” he said. “Our country's credibility is at stake.” Dae-jung then switched the presidential
plane from Korean A ir to its newer rival, Asiana.
But then a small miracle happened. Korean Air turned itself around. Today, the airline is a
member in good standing of the prestigious SkyTeam alliance. Its safety record since 1999 is
spotless. In 2006, Korean Air was given the Phoenix Award by Air Transport World in
recognition of its transformation. Aviation experts will tell you that Korean Air is now as safe as
any airline in the world.
In this chapter, we're going to conduct a crash investigation: listen to the “black box” cockpit
recorder; examine the flight records; look at the weather and the terrain and the airport
conditions; and compare the Guam crash with other very similar plane crashes, all in an attempt
to understand precisely how the company transformed itself from the worst kind of outlier into
one of the world's best airlines. It is a complex and sometimes strange story. But it turns on a
very simple fact, the same fact that runs through the tangled history of Harlan and the Michigan
students. Korean Air did not succeedit did not right itselfuntil it acknowledged the importance of
its cultural legacy.
3.
Planes crashes rarely happen in real life the same way they happen in the movies. Some engine
part does not explode in a fiery bang. The rudder doesn't suddenly snap under the force of
takeoff. The captain doesn't gasp, “Dear God,” as he's thrown back against his seat. The typical
commercial jetlinerat this point in its stage of developmentis about as dependable as a toaster.
Plane crashes are much more likely to be the result of an accumulation of minor difficulties and
seemingly trivial malfunctions."'
* This is true not just of plane crashes. It's true of virtually all industrial accidents. One of the
most famous accidents in history, for example, was the near meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three
Mile Island nuclear station in 1979. Three Mile Island so traumatized the American public that it
sent the US nuclear power industry into a tailspin from which it has never fully recovered. But
what actually happened at that nuclear reactor began as something far from dramatic. As the
sociologist Charles Perrow shows in his classic Normal Accidents, therewas arelatively routine
Page 79/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
blockage in what is called the plant's “polisher”a kind of giant water filter. The blockage caused
moisture to leak into the plant's air system, inadvertently tripping two valves and shutting down
the flow of cold water into the plant's steam generator. Like all nuclear reactors, Three Mile
Island had a backup cooling system for precisely this situation. But on that particular day, for
reasons that no one really understands, the valves for the backup system weren't open.
Someone had closed them, and an indicator in the control room showing they were closed was
blocked by a repair tag hanging from a switch above it. That left the reactor dependent on
another backup system, a special sort of relief valve. But, as luck would have it, the relief valve
wasn't working properly that day either. It stuck open when it was supposed to close, and, to
make matters even worse, a gauge in the control room that should have told the operators that
the relief valve wasn't working was itself not working. By the time Three Mile Island's engineers
realized what was happening, the reactor had come dangerously close to a meltdown.
No single big thing went wrong at Three Mile Island. Rather, five completely unrelated events
occurred in sequence, each of which, had it happened in isolation, would have caused no more
than a hiccup in the plant's ordinary operation.
In a typical crash, for example, the weather is poor not terrible, necessarily, but bad enough that
the pilot feels a little bit more stressed than usual. In an overwhelming number of crashes, the
plane is behind schedule, so the pilots are hurrying. In 52 percent of crashes, the pilot at the
time of the accident has been awake for twelve hours or more, meaning that he is tired and not
thinking sharply. And 44 percent of the time, the two pilots have never flown together before,
so they're not comfortable with each other. Then the errors startand it's not just one error. The
typical accident involves seven consecutive human errors. One of the pilots does something
wrong that by itself is not a problem. Then one of them makes another error on top of that,
which combined with the first error still does not amount to catastrophe. But then they make a
third error on top of that, and then another and another and another and another, and it is the
combination of all those errors that leads to disaster.
These seven errors, furthermore, are rarely problems of knowledge or flying skill. It's not that
the pilot has to negotiate some critical technical maneuver and fails. The kinds of errors that
cause plane crashes are invariably errors of teamwork and communication. One pilot knows
something important and somehow doesn't tell the other pilot. One pilot does something
wrong, and the other pilot doesn't catch the error. A tricky situation needs to be resolved
through a complex series of stepsand somehow the pilots fail to coordinate and miss one of
them.
“The whole flight-deck design is intended to be operated by two people, and that operation
works best when you have one person checking the other, or both people willing to
participate,“ says Earl Weener, who was for many years chief engineer for safety at Boeing.
”Airplanes are very unforgiving if you don't do things right. And for a long time it's been clear
that if you have two people operating the airplane cooperatively, you will have a safer operation
than if you have a single pilot flying the plane and another person who is simply there to take
over if the pilot is incapacitated.”
Consider, for example, the famous (in aviation circles, anyway) crash of the Colombian airliner
Avianca flight 052 in January of 1990. The Avianca accident so perfectly illustrates the
characteristics of the “modern” plane crash that it is studied in flight schools. In fact, what
Page 80/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
happened to that flight is so similar to what would happen seven years later in Guam that it's a
good place to start our investigation into the mystery of Korean Air's plane crash problem.
The captain of the plane was Laureano Caviedes. His first officer was Mauricio Klotz. They
were en route from Medellin, Colombia, to New York City's Kennedy Airport. The weather that
evening was poor. There was a nor'easter up and down the East Coast, bringing with it dense
fog and high winds. Two hundred and three flights were delayed at Newark Airport. Two
hundred flights were delayed at LaGuardia Airport, 161 at Philadelphia, 53 at Boston's Logan
Airport, and 99 at Kennedy. Because of the weather, Avianca was held up by Air Traffic
Control three times on its way to New York. The plane circled over Norfolk, Virginia, for
nineteen minutes, above Atlantic City for twenty-nine minutes, and forty miles south of Kennedy
Airport for another twenty-nine minutes.
After an hour and a quarter of delay, Avianca was cleared for landing. As the plane came in on
its final approach, the pilots encountered severe wind shear. One moment they were flying into
a strong headwind, forcing them to add extra power to maintain their momentum on the glide
down. The next moment, without warning, the headwind dropped dramatically, and they were
traveling much too fast to make the runway. Typically, the plane would have been flying on
autopilot in that situation, reacting immediately and appropriately to wind shear. But the
autopilot on the plane was malfunctioning, and it had been switched off. A t the last moment,
the pilot pulled up, and executed a “go-around.” The plane did a wide circle over Long Island,
and reapproached Kennedy Airport. Suddenly, one of the plane's engines failed. Seconds later,
a second engine failed. “Show me the runway!” the pilot cried out, hoping desperately that he
was close enough to Kennedy to somehow glide his crippled plane to a safe landing. But
Kennedy was sixteen miles away.
The 707 slammed into the estate owned by the father of the tennis champion John McEnroe,in
the posh Long Island town of Oyster Bay. Seventy-three of the 158 passengers aboard died. It
took less than a day for the cause of the crash to be determined: “fuel exhaustion.” There was
nothing wrong with the aircraft. There was nothing wrong with the airport. The pilots weren't
drunk or high. The plane had run out of gas.
4.
“ It's a classic case,” said Suren Ratwatte, a veteran pilot who has been involved for years in
“human factors” research, which is the analysis of how human beings interact with complex
systems like nuclear power plants and airplanes. Ratwatte is Sri Lankan, a lively man in his
forties who has been flying commercial jets his entire adult life. We were sitting in the lobby of
the Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan. He'd just landed a jumbo jet at Kennedy Airport after a long
flight from Dubai. Ratwatte knew the Avianca case well. He began to tick off the typical crash
preconditions. The nor'easter. The delayed flight. The minor technical malfunction with the
autopilot. The three long holding patternswhich meant not only eighty minutes of extra flying
time but extra flying at low altitudes, where a plane burns far more fuel than it does in the thin
air high above the clouds.
“They were flying a seven-oh-seven, which is an older airplane and is very challenging to fly,”
Ratwatte said. “That thing is a lot of work. The flight controls are not hydraulically powered.
They are connected by a series of pulleys and pull rods to the physical metal surfaces of the
Page 81/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
airplane. You have to be quite strong to fly that air plane. You heave it around the sky. It's as
much physical effort as rowing a boat. My current airplane I fly with my fingertips. I use a
joystick. My instruments are huge. Theirs were the size of coffee cups. And his autopilot was
gone. So the captain had to keep looking around these nine instruments, each the size of a
coffee cup, while his right hand was controlling the speed, and his left hand was flying the
airplane. He was maxed out. He had no resources left to do anything else. That's what happens
when you're tired. Your decision-making skills erode. You start missing thingsthings that you
would pick up on any other day.”
In the black box recovered from the crash site, Captain Caviedes in the final hour of the flight is
heard to repeatedly ask for the directions from ATC to be translated into Spanish, as if he no
longer had the energy to make use of his English. O n nine occasions, he also asked for
directions to be repeated. “Tell me things louder,” he said right near the end. “I'm not hearing
them.” When the plane was circling for forty minutes just southeast of Kennedywhen everyone
on the flight deck clearly knew they were running out of fuelthe pilot could easily have asked to
land at Philadelphia, which was just sixty-five miles away. But he didn't: it was as if he had
locked in on New York. On the aborted landing, the plane's Ground Proximity Warning System
went off no fewer than fifteen times, telling the captain that he was bringing in the plane too
low. He seemed oblivious. When he aborted the landing, he should have circled back around
immediately, and he didn't. He was exhausted.
Through it all, the cockpit was filled with a heavy silence. Sitting next to Caviedes was his first
officer, Mauricio Klotz, and in the flight recorder, there are long stretches of nothing but rustling
and engine noise. It was Klotz's responsibility to conduct all communication with A T C , which
meant that his role that night was absolutely critical. But his behavior was oddly passive. It wasn't
until the third holding pattern southwest of Kennedy Airport that Klotz told A T C that he didn't
think the plane had enough fuel to reach an alternative airport. The next thing the crew heard
from ATC was “Just stand by” and, following that, “Cleared to the Kennedy airport.”
Investigators later surmised that the A vianca pilots must have assumed that A T C was jumping
them to the head of the queue, in front of the dozens of other planes circling Kennedy. In fact,
they weren't. They were just being added to the end of the line. It was a crucial
misunderstanding, upon which the fate of the plane would ultimately rest. But did the pilots raise
the issue again, looking for clarificationNo. Nor did they bring up the issue of fuel again for
another thirty-eight minutes.
5.
To Ratwatte, the silence in the cockpit made no sense. And as a way of explaining why,
Ratwatte began to talk about what had happened to him that morning on the way over from
Dubai. “We had this lady in the back,” he said. “We reckon she was having a stroke. Seizing.
Vomiting. In bad shape. She was an Indian lady whose daughter lives in the States. Her husband
spoke no English, no Hindi, only Punjabi. No one could communicate with him. He looked like
he had just walked off a village in the Punjab, and they had absolutely no money. I was actually
over Moscow when it happened, but I knew we couldn't go to Moscow. I didn't know what
would happen to these people if we did. I said to the first officer, 'You fly the plane. We have to
go to Helsinki.' ”
The immediate problem Ratwatte faced was that they were less than halfway through a very
Page 82/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
long flight, which meant that they had far more fuel in their tanks than they usually do when it
comes time to land. “We were sixty tons over maximum landing weight,” he said. “So now I had
to make a choice. I could dump the fuel. But countries hate it when you dump fuel. It's messy
stuff and they would have routed me somewhere over the Baltic Sea, and it would have taken
me forty minutes and the lady probably would have died. So I decided to land anyway. My
choice.”
That meant the plane was “landing heavy.” They couldn't use the automated landing system
because it wasn't set up to handle a plane with that much weight.
“At that stage, I took over the controls,” he went on. "I had to ensure that the airplane touched
down very softly; otherwise, there would have been the risk of structural damage. It could have
been a real mess. There are also performance issues with being heavy. If you clear the runway
and have to go around, you may not have enough thrust to climb back up.
"It was a lot of work. You're juggling a lot of balls. You've got to get it right. Because it was a
long flight, there were two other pilots. So I got them up, and they got involved in doing
everything as well. We had four people up there, which really helped in coordinating everything.
I'd never been to Helsinki before. I had no idea how the airport was, no idea whether the
runways were long enough. I had to find an approach, figure out if we could land there, figure
out the performance parameters, and tell the company what we were doing. At one point I was
talking to three different peopletalking to Dubai, talking to MedLink, which is a service in
Arizona where they put a doctor on call, and I was talking to the two doctors who were
attending to the lady in the back. It was nonstop for forty minutes.
“We were lucky the weather was very good in Helsinki,” he said. “Trying to do an approach in
bad weather, plus a heavy plane, plus an unfamiliar airport, that's not good. Because it was
Finland, a first-world country, they were well set up, very flexible. I said to them, 'I'm heavy. I
would like to land into the wind/ You want to slow yourself down in that situation. They said, No
problem. They landed us in the opposite direction than they normally use. We came in over the
city, which they usually avoid for noise reasons.”
Think about what was required of Ratwatte. He had to be a good pilot. That much goes without
saying: he had to have the technical skill to land heavy. But almost everything else Ratwatte did
that made that emergency landing a success fell outside the strict definition of piloting skills.
He had to weigh the risk of damaging his plane against the risk to the woman's life, and then,
once that choice was made, he had to think through the implications of Helsinki versus Moscow
for the sick passenger in the back. He had to educate himself, quickly, on the parameters of an
airport he had never seen before: could it handle one of the biggest jets in the sky, at sixty tons
over its normal landing weightBut most of all, he had to talkto the passengers, to the doctors, to
his copilot, to the second crew he woke up from their nap, to his superiors back home in Dubai,
to ATC at Helsinki. It is safe to say that in the forty minutes that passed between the
passenger's stroke and the landing in Helsinki, there were no more than a handful of seconds of
silence in the cockpit. What was required of Ratwatte was that he communicate, and
communicate not just in the sense of issuing commands but also in the sense of encouraging and
cajoling and calming and negotiating and sharing information in the clearest and most
transparent manner possible.

Here, by contrast, is the transcript from Avianca 052, as the plane is going in for its abortive
first landing. The issue is the weather. The fog is so thick that Klotz and Caviedes cannot figure
out where they are. Pay close attention, though, not to the content of their conversation but to
the form. In particular, note the length of the silences between utterances and to the tone of
Klotz's remarks.
CAVIEDES: The runway, where is itI don't see it. I don't see it.
They take up the landing gear. The captain tells Klotz to ask for another traffic pattern. Ten
seconds pass.
CAVIEDES [SEEMINGLY TO HIMSELF] : We don't have fuel...
Seventeen seconds pass as the pilots give technical instructions to each other.
CAVIEDES: I don't know what happened with the runway. I didn't see it.
KLOTZ: I didn't see it.
Air Traffic Control comes in and tells them to make a left turn.
CAVIEDES: Tell them we are in an emergency! KLOTZ [TO ATC]: That's right to one-eightzero on the heading and, ah, we'll try once again. We're run?
ning out of fuel.
Imagine the scene in the cockpit. The plane is dangerously low on fuel. They have just blown
their first shot at a landing. They have no idea how much longer the plane is capable of flying.
The captain is desperate: “Tell them we are in an emergency!” And what does Klotz sayThat's
right to one-eight-zero on the heading and, ah, we'll try once again. We're running out of fuel.
To begin with, the phrase “running out of fuel” has no meaning in Air Traffic Control
terminology. All planes, as they approach their destination, are by definition running out of fuel.
Did Klotz mean that 052 no longer had enough fuel to make it to another, alternative airportDid
he mean that they were beginning to get worried about their fuelNext, consider the structure of
the critical sentence. Klotz begins with a routine acknowledgment of the instructions from A T C
and doesn't mention his concern about fuel until the second half of the sentence. It's as if he
were to say in a restaurant, “Yes, I'll have some more coffee and, ah, I'm choking on a chicken
bone.” How seriously would the waiter take himThe air traffic controller with whom Klotz was
speaking testified later that he “just took it as a passing comment.” On stormy nights, air traffic
controllers hear pilots talking about running out of fuel all the time.
Even the “ah” that Klotz inserts between the two halves of his sentence serves to undercut the
importance of what he is saying. According to another of the controllers who handled 052 that
night, Klotz spoke “in a very nonchalant manner There was no urgency in the voice.”
7.
The term used by linguists to describe what Klotz was engaging in in that moment is “mitigated
Page 84/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
speech,” which refers to any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being
said. We mitigate when we're being polite, or when we're ashamed or embarrassed, or when
we're being deferential to authority. If you want your boss to do you a favor, you don't say, “I'll
need this by Monday.” You mitigate. You say, “Don't bother, if it's too much trouble, but if you
have a chance to look at this over the weekend, that would be wonderful.” In a situation like
that, mitigation is entirely appropriate. In other situations, howeverlike a cockpit on a stormy
nightit's a problem.
The linguists Ute Fischer and Judith Orasanu once gave the following hypothetical scenario to a
group of captains and first officers and asked them how they would respond:
You notice on the weather radar an area of heavy precipitation 25 miles ahead. [The pilot] is
maintaining his present course at Mach .73, even though embedded thunderstorms have been
reported in your area and you encounter moderate turbulence. You want to ensure that your
aircraft will not penetrate this area.
Question: what do you say to the pilot?
Command: “Turn thirty degrees right.” That's the most direct and explicit way of making a point
imaginable. It's zero mitigation. Crew Obligation Statement: “I think we need to deviate right
about now.” Notice the use of “we” and the fact that the request is now much less specific.
That's a little softer .
Crew Suggestion: “Let's go around the weather.” Implicit In Fischer's and Orasanu's minds,
there were at least six ways to try to persuade the pilot to change course and avoid the bad
weather, each with a different level of mitigation.
in that statement is “we're in this together.” 4. Query: “Which direction would you like to
deviate?” That's even softer than a crew suggestion, because the speaker is conceding that he's
not in charge. 5. Preference: “I think it would be wise to turn left or right.” 6. Hint: “That return
at twenty-five miles looks mean.”
This is the most mitigated statement of all.
Fischer and Orasanu found that captains overwhelmingly said they would issue a command in
that situation: “Turn thirty degrees right.” They were talking to a subordinate. They had no fear
of being blunt. The first officers, on the other hand, were talking to their boss, and so they
overwhelmingly chose the most mitigated alternative. They hinted.
It's hard to read Fischer and Orasanu's study and not be just a little bit alarmed, because a hint is
the hardest kind of request to decode and the easiest to refuse. In the 1982 A ir Florida crash
outside W ashington, D C , the first officer tried three times to tell the captain that the plane had
a dangerous amount of ice on its wings. But listen to how he says it. It's all hints:
FIRST OFFICER: Look how the ice is just hanging on his, ah, back, back there, see that?
Then:
FIRST OFFICER: See all those icicles on the back there and everything?
Page 85/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
And then:
FIRST OFFICER: Boy, this is a, this is a losing battle here on trying to de-ice those things, it
[gives] you a false feeling of security, that's all that does.
Finally, as they get clearance for takeoff, the first officer upgrades two notches to a crew
suggestion:
FIRST OFFICER: Let's check those [wing] tops again, since we've been setting here awhile.
CAPTAIN: I think we get to go here in a minute.
The last thing the first officer says to the captain, just before the plane plunges into the Potomac
River, is not a hint, a suggestion, or a command. It's a simple statement of factand this time the
captain agrees with him.
FIRST OFFICER: Larry, we're going down, Larry. CAPTAIN: I know it.
19 6 THE ETHNIC THEORY OF PLANE CRASHES Mitigation explains one of the great
anomalies of plane crashes. In commercial airlines, captains and first officers split the flying
duties equally. But historically, crashes have been far more likely to happen when the captain is
in the “flying seat.” At first that seems to make no sense, since the captain is almost always the
pilot with the most experience. But think about the Air Florida crash. If the first officer had been
the captain, would he have hinted three timesNo, he would have commandedand the plane
wouldn't have crashed. Planes are safer when the least experienced pilot is flying, because it
means the second pilot isn't going to be afraid to speak up.
Combating mitigation has become one of the great crusades in commercial aviation in the past
fifteen years. Every major airline now has what is called “Crew Resource Management” training,
which is designed to teach junior crew members how to communicate clearly and assertively.
For example, many airlines teach a standardized procedure for copilots to challenge the pilot if
he or she thinks something has gone terribly awry. (“Captain, I'm concerned about...” Then,
“Captain, I'm uncomfortable with...” And if the captain still doesn't respond, “Captain, I believe
the situation is unsafe.” A nd if that fails, the first officer is required to take over the airplane.) A
viation experts will tell you that it is the success of this war on mitigation as much as anything
else that accounts for the extraordinary decline in airline accidents in recent years.
“On a very simple level, one of the things we insist upon at my airline is that the first officer and
the captain call each other by their first names,” Ratwatte said. “W e think that helps. It's just
harder to say, 'Captain, you're doing something wrong,' than to use a name.“ Ratwatte took
mitigation very seriously.You couldn'tbeastudentoftheAviancacrashand not feel that way. He
went on: ”One thing I personally try to do is, I try to put myself a little down. I say to my
copilots, T don't fly very often. Three or four times a month. You fly a lot more. If you see me
doing something stupid, it's because I don't fly very often. So tell me. Help me out.' Hopefully,
that helps them speak up.”
8.
Back to the cockpit of Avianca 052. The plane is now turning away from Kennedy, after the
aborted first attempt at landing. Klotz has just been on the radio with ATC, trying to figure out
Page 86/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
when they can try to land again. Caviedes turns to him.
CAVIEDES: What did he sayKLOTZ: I already advise him that we are going to attempt again
because we now we can't..."
Four seconds of silence pass.
CAVIEDES: Advise him we are in emergency.
Four more seconds of silence pass. The captain tries again.
CAVIEDES: Did you tell himKLOTZ: Yes, sir. I already advise him.
Klotz starts talking to A TCgoing over routine details.
KLOTZ: One-five-zero maintaining two thousand A vianca zero-five-two heavy.
The captain is clearly at the edge of panic.
CAVIEDES: Advise him we don't have...
Klotz gets back on the radio with A T C .
KLOTZ: Climb and maintain three...
T h e r e i t is a g a i n . N o m e n t i o n o f t h e m a g i c w o r d “ e m e r gency,” which is
what air traffic controllers are trained to listen for. Just “running out of fuel, sir” at the end of a
sentence, preceded by the mitigating “ah.” If you're counting errors, the Avianca crew is now in
double digits.
CAVIEDES: Did you already advise that we don't have fuel?
KLOTZ: Yes, sir. I already advise...
If it were not the prelude to a tragedy, their back-and-forth would resemble an Abbott and
Costello comedy routine.
A little over a minute passes.
ATC: And Avianca zero-five-two heavy, ah, I'm gonna bring you about fifteen miles northeast
and then turn you back onto the approach. Is that okay with you and your fuel?
KLOTZ: I guess so. Thank you very...
I guess so. Thank you very much. They are about to crash! One of the flight attendants enters
the cockpit to find out how serious the situation is. The flight engineer points to the empty fuel
gauge, and makes a throat-cutting gesture with his finger.* But he says nothing. Nor does
anyone else for the next five minutes. There's radio chatter and routine business, and then the
flight engineer cries out, “Flameout on engine number four!”
Caviedes says, “Show me the runway,” but the runway is sixteen miles away.
Thirty-six seconds of silence pass. The plane's air traffic controller calls out one last time.
Page 87/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
A TC: You have, ah, you have enough fuel to make it to...
The transcript ends.

“The thing you have to understand about that crash,” Ratwatte said, "is that New York air traffic
controllers are famous for being rude, aggressive, and bullying. They are also very good. They
handle a phenomenal amount of traffic in a very constrained environment. There is a famous
story about a pilot who got lost trafficking around JFK. You have no idea how easy that is to do
at JFK once you're on the ground. It's a maze. Anyway, a female con-
* We know this because the flight attendant survived the crash and testified at the inquest.
troller got mad at him, and said, 'Stop. Don't do anything. Do not talk to me until I talk to you.'
And she just left him there. Finally the pilot picks up the microphone and says, 'Madam. Was I
married to you in a former life?'
“They are unbelievable. The way they look at it, it's 'I'm in control. Shut up and do what I say.'
They will snap at you. And if you don't like what they tell you to do, you have to snap back. And
then they'll say, 'All right, then.' But if you don't, they'll railroad you. I remember a British
Airways flight was going into New York. They were being stuffed around by New York Air
Traffic Control. The British pilots said, 'You people should go to Heathrow and learn how to
control an airplane.' It's all in the spirit. If you are not used to that sort of give-and-take, New
York A TC can be very, very intimidating. And those Avianca guys were just intimidated by the
rapid fire.”
It is impossible to imagine Ratwatte not making his case to Kennedy A TCnot because he is
obnoxious or pushy or has an enormous ego, but because he sees the world differently. If he
needed help in the cockpit, he would wake up the second crew. If he thought Moscow was
wrong, well, he would just go to Helsinki, and if Helsinki was going to bring him in with the
wind, well, he was going to talk them into bringing him in against the wind. That morning, when
they were leaving Helsinki, he had lined up the plane on the wrong runwayand his first officer
had quickly pointed out the error. The memory made Ratwatte laugh. “Masa is Swiss. He was
very happy to correct me. He was giving me shit the whole way back.”
Ratwatte continued: “All the guys had to do was tell the controller, 'W e don't have the fuel to
comply with what 2OI you are trying to do/ Allthey had to do was say,'Wecan't do that. We
have to land in the next ten minutes.' They weren't able to put that across to the controller.”
It was at this point that Ratwatte began to speak carefully, because he was about to make the
kind of cultural generalization that often leaves us uncomfortable. But what happened with
Avianca was just so strangeso seemingly inexplicablethat it demanded a more complete
explanation than simply that Klotz was incompetent and the captain was tired. There was
something more profoundmore structuralgoing on in that cockpit. What if there was something
about the pilots' being Colombian that led to that crash“Look, no American pilot would put up
with that. That's the thing,” Ratwatte said. “They would say, 'Listen, buddy. I have to land.' ”
10.
Page 88/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede was working for the human
resources department of IBM's European headquarters. Hofstede's job was to travel the globe
and interview employees, asking about such things as how people solved problems and how
they worked together and what their attitudes were to authority. The questionnaires were long
and involved, and over time Hofstede was able to develop an enormous database for analyzing
the ways in which cultures differ from one another. Today “Hofstede's Dimensions” are among
the most widely used paradigms in crosscultural psychology.
Hofstede argued, for example, that cultures can be usefully distinguished according to how much
they expect individuals to look after themselves. He called that measurement the “individualismcollectivism scale.” The country that scores highest on the individualism end of that scale is the
United States. Not surprisingly, the United States is also the only industrialized country in the
world that does not provide its citizens with universal health care. At the opposite end of the
scale is Guatemala.
Another of Hofstede's dimensions is “uncertainty avoidance.” How well does a culture tolerate
ambiguityHere are the top five “uncertainty avoidance” countries, according to Hofstede's
databasethat is, the countries most reliant on rules and plans and most likely to stick to
procedure regardless of circumstances:
1. Greece 2. Portugal 3. Guatemala 4. Uruguay 5. Belgium The bottom fivethat is, the cultures
best able to tolerate ambiguityare:
It is important to note that Hofstede wasn't suggesting that there was a right place or a wrong
place to be on any one of these scales. Nor was he saying that a culture's position on one of his
dimensions was an ironclad predictor of how someone from that country behaves: it's not
impossible, for example, for someone from Guatemala to be highly individualistic.
What he was saying, instead, was something very similar to what Nisbett and Cohen argued
after their hallway studies at the University of Michigan. Each of us has his or her own distinct
personality. But overlaid on top of that are tendencies and assumptions and reflexes handed
down to us by the history of the community we grew up in, and those differences are
extraordinarily specific.
Belgium and Denmark are only an hour or so apart by airplane, for example. Danes look a lot
like Belgians, and if you were dropped on a street corner in Copenhagen, you wouldn't find it all
that different from a street corner in Brussels. But when it comes to uncertainty avoidance, the
two nations could not be further apart. In fact, Danes have more in common with Jamaicans
when it comes to tolerating ambiguity than they do with some of their European peers.
Denmark and Belgium may share in a kind of broad European liberal-democratic tradition, but
they have different histories, different political structures, different religious traditions, and
different languages and food and architecture and literaturegoing back hundreds and hundreds of
years. And the sum total of all those differences is that in certain kinds of situations that require
dealing with risk and uncertainty, Danes tend to react in a very different way from Belgians.
Of all of Hofstede's Dimensions, though, perhaps the most interesting is what he called the
“Power Distance Index” (PDI). Power distance is concerned with attitudes toward hierarchy,
specifically with how much a particular culture values and respects authority. To measure it,
Page 89/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Hofstede asked questions like “How frequently, in your experience, does the following problem
occur: employees being afraid to express disagreement with their managers?” To what extent
do the “less powerful members of orga nizations and institutions accept and expect that power is
distributed unequally?” How much are older people respected and fearedAre power holders
entitled to special privileges?
“In low-power distance index countries,” Hofstede wrote in his classic text Culture's
Consequences:
power is something of which power holders are almost ashamed and they will try to underplay. I
once heard a Swedish (low PDI) university official state that in order to exercise power he tried
not to look powerful. Leaders may enhance their informal status by renouncing formal symbols.
In (low PDI) Austria, Prime Minister Bruno Kreisky was known to sometimes take the streetcar
to work. In 1974,1 actually saw the Dutch (low PDI) prime minister, Joop den Uyl, on vacation
with his motor home at a camping site in Portugal. Such behavior of the powerful would be very
unlikely in high-PDI Belgium or France.“”
* Hofstede, similarly, references a study done a few years ago that compared German and
French manufacturing plants that were in the same industry and were roughly the same size.
The French plants had, on average, 26 percent of their employees in management and
specialist positions; the Germans, 16 percent. The French, furthermore, paid their top
management substantially more than the Germans did. What You can imagine the effect that
Hofstede's findings had on people in the aviation industry. What was their great battle over
mitigated speech and teamwork all about, after allIt was an attempt to reduce power distance in
the cockpit. Hofstede's question about power distance“How frequently, in your experience,
does the following problem occur: employees being afraid to express disagreement with their
managers?”was the very question aviation experts were asking first officers in their dealings with
captains. And Hofstede's work suggested something that had not occurred to anyone in the
aviation world: that the task of convincing first officers to assert themselves was going to depend
an awful lot on their culture's power distance rating.
That's what Ratwatte meant when he said that no American would have been so fatally
intimidated by the controllers at Kennedy Airport. America is a classic low-power distance
culture. When push comes to shove, Americans fall back on their American-ness, and that
American-ness means that the air traffic controller is thought of as an equal. But what country is
at the other end of the power distance scaleColombia.
In the wake of the Avianca crash, the psychologist Robert Helmreich, who has done more than
anyone to argue for the role of culture in explaining pilot behavior, wrote a brilliant analysis of
the accident in which he argued that we are seeing in that comparison, Hofstede argued, is a
difference in cultural attitudes toward hierarchy. The French have a power distance index twice
that of the Germans. They require and support hierarchy in a way the Germans simply don't.
you couldn't understand Klotz's behavior without taking into account his nationality, that his
predicament that day was uniquely the predicament of someone who had a deep and abiding
respect for authority. Helmreich wrote:
The high-power distance of Colombians could have created frustration on the part of the first
Page 90/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
officer because the captain failed to show the kind of clear (if not autocratic) decision making
expected in high-power distance cultures. The first and second officers may have been waiting
for the captain to make decisions, but still may have been unwilling to pose alternatives.
Klotz sees himself as a subordinate. It's not his job to solve the crisis. It's the captain'sand the
captain is exhausted and isn't saying anything. Then there's the domineering Kennedy A irport
air traffic controllers ordering the planes around. Klotz is trying to tell them he's in trouble. But
he's using his own cultural language, speaking as a subordinate would to a superior. The
controllers, though, aren't Colombian. They're low-power distance New Yorkers. They don't
see any hierarchical gap between themselves and the pilots in the air, and to them, mitigated
speech from a pilot doesn't mean the speaker is being appropriately deferential to a superior. It
means the pilot doesn't have a problem.
There is a point in the transcript where the cultural miscommunication between the controllers
and Klotz becomes so evident that it is almost painful to read. It's the last exchange between
Avianca and the control tower, just minutes before the crash. Klotz has just said, “I guess so.
Thank you very much” in response to the controller's question about their fuel state. Captain
Caviedes then turns to Klotz.
CAVIEDES: What did he say
KLOTZ: The guy is angry.
Angry! Klotz's feelings are hurt! His plane is moments from disaster. But he cannot escape the
dynamic dictated to him by his culture in which subordinates must respect the dictates of their
superiors. In his mind, he has tried and failed to communicate his plight, and his only conclusion
is that he must have somehow offended his superiors in the control tower.
In the aftermath of the Kennedy crash, the management of Avianca airlines held a postmortem.
Avianca had just had four accidents in quick successionBarranquilla, Cucuta, Madrid, and New
Yorkand all four cases, the airline concluded, “had to do with airplanes in perfect flight
condition, aircrew without physical limitations and considered of average or above-average flight
ability, and still the accidents happened.” (italics mine)
In the company's Madrid crash, the report went on, the copilot tried to warn the captain about
how dangerous the situation was:
The copilot was right. But they died because... when the copilot asked questions, his implied
suggestions were very weak. The captain's reply was to ignore him totally. Per haps the copilot
did not want to appear rebellious, questioning the judgment of the captain, or he did not want to
play the fool because he knew that the pilot had a great deal of experience flying in that area.
The copilot should have advocated for his own opinions in a stronger way...
Our ability to succeed at what we do is powerfully bound up with where we re from, and being a
good pilot and coming from a high-power distance culture is a difficult mix. Colombia by no
means has the highest PDI, by the way. Helmreich and a colleague, Ashleigh Merritt, once
measured the P D I of pilots from around the world. Number one was Brazil. Number two was
South Korea.“”

The National Transportation Safety Board, the US agency responsible for investigating plane
crashes, is headquartered in a squat, seventies-era office building on the banks * Here are the
topfivepilot PDIs by country. If you compare this list to the ranking of plane crashes by country,
they match up very closely.
1. Brazil 2. South Korea 3. Morocco 4.Mexico 5. Philippines Thefivelowest pilot PDIs by
country are:
15. United States 16. Ireland 17. South Africa 18. Australia 19. New Zealand of the Potomac
River in Washington, DC. Off the agency's long hallways are laboratories filled with airplane
wreckage: a mangled piece of an engine turbine, a problematic piece of a helicopter rotor. On a
shelf in one of the laboratories is the cockpit voice and data recorderthe so-called black boxfrom
the devastating Valujet crash in Florida in 1996, in which n o people were killed. The recorder
is encased in a shoe box-size housing made out of thick hardened steel, and on one end of the
box is a jagged hole, as if someoneor, rather, somethinghad driven a stake into it with
tremendous force. Some of the NTSB investigators are engineers, who reconstruct crashes from
the material evidence. Others are pilots. A surprising number of them, however, are
psychologists, whose job it is to listen to the cockpit recorder and reconstruct what was said and
done by the flight crew in the final minutes before a crash. One of the NTSB's leading black-box
specialists is a gangly fiftyish PhD psychologist named Malcolm Brenner, and Brenner was one
of the investigators into the Korean Air crash in Guam.
“Normally that approach into Guam is not difficult,” Brenner began. Guam airport has what is
called a glide scope, which is like a giant beam of light stretching up into the sky from the
airport, and the pilot simply follows the beam all the way down to the runway. But on this
particular night, the glide scope was down. “It was out of service,” Brenner said. “It had been
sent to another island to be repaired. So there was a notice to airmen that the glide scope was
not operating.”
In the grand scheme of things, this should not have been a big problem. In the month the glide
scope had been under repair, there had been about fifteen hundred safe landings at Guam
airport. It was just a small thingan inconvenience, reallythat made the task of landing a plane just
a little bit more difficult.
“The second complication was the weather,” Brenner continued. “Normally in the South
Pacific, you've got these brief weather situations. But they go by quickly. You don't have storms.
It's a tropical paradise. But that night, there were some little cells, and it just happens that that
evening, they were going to be flying into one of those little cells, a few miles from the airport.
So the captain has to decide, W hat exactly is my procedure for landingWell, they were cleared
for what's called a VOR/DME approach. It's complicated. It's a pain in the ass. It takes a lot of
coordination to set it up. You have to come down in steps. But then, as it happens, from miles
out, the captain seesthelightsofGuam.Soherelaxes.And hesays,'We're doing a visual approach.'
”
The VOR is a beacon that sends out a signal that allows pilots to calculate their altitude as they
approach an airport. It's what pilots relied on before the invention of the glide scope. The
Page 92/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
captain's strategy was to use the V O R to get the plane close and then, once he could see the
lights of the runway, to land the plane visually. It seemed to make sense. Pilots do visual landings
all the time. But every time a pilot chooses a plan, he is supposed to prepare a backup in case
things go awry. A nd this captain didn't.
“They should have been coordinating. He should have been briefing for the [DME]step-downs,”
Brenner went on. “But he doesn't talk about that. The storm cells are all around them, and what
the captain seems to be doing is assuming that at some point he's going to break out of the
clouds and see the airport, and if he doesn't see it by five hundred sixty feet, he'll just go
around. Now, that would work, except for one more thing. The V O R on which he's basing this
strategy is not at the airport. It's two-point-five miles away on Nimitz Hill. There's a number of
airports in the world where this is true. Sometimes you can follow the V O R down and it takes
you straight to the airport. Here if you follow the V O R down, it takes you straight to Nimitz
Hill.”
The pilot knew about the VOR. It was clearly stated in the airport's navigational charts. He'd
flown into Guam eight times before, and in fact, he had specifically mentioned it in the briefing
he gave before takeoff. But then again, it was one in the morning, and he'd been up since six
a.m. the previous day.
“We believe that fatigue was involved,” Brenner went on. “It's a back-of-the-clock flight. You fly
in and arrive at one in the morning, Korean time. Then you spend a few hours on the ground,
and you fly back as the sun is coming up. The captain has flown it a month before. In that case,
he slept on the first-class seat. Now he's flying in and says he's really tired.”
So there they are, three classic preconditions of a plane crash, the same three that set the stage
for Avianca 052: a minor technical malfunction; bad weather; and a tired pilot. By itself, none of
these would be sufficient for an accident. But all three in combination require the combined
efforts of everyone in the cockpit. And that's where Korean Air 801 ran into trouble.
12.
Here is the flight recorder transcript of the final thirty minutes of K A L flight 801: It begins with
the captain complaining of exhaustion.
0120:01. CAPTAIN: If this round-trip is more than a nine-hour trip, we might get a little
something. With eight hours, we get nothing. Eight hours do not help us at all.... They make us
work to maximum, up to maximum. Probably this way... hotel expenses will be saved for cabin
crews, and maximize the flight hours. Anyway, they make us... work to maximum.
There is the sound of a man shifting in his seat. A minute passes.
0121:13. CAPTAIN: Eh... really... sleepy, [unintelligible words]
FIRST OFFICER:...
The first officer decides to speak up:
FIRST OFFICER:...
Page 93/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
The first officer must have thought long and hard before making that comment. He was not
flying in the easy collegiality of Suren Ratwatte's cockpit. Among Korean Air flight crews, the
expectation on layovers used to be that the junior officers would attend to the captain to the
point of making him dinner or purchasing him gifts. As one former Korean Air pilot puts it, the
sensibility in many of the airline's cockpits was that “the captain is in charge and does what he
wants, when he likes, how he likes, and everyone else sits quietly and does nothing.” In the
Delta report on Korean Air that was posted anonymously on the Internet, one of the auditors
tells a story of sitting in on a Korean Air flight where the first officer got confused while listening
to Air Traffic Control and mistakenly put the plane on a course intended for another plane.
“The Flight Engineer picked up something was wrong but said nothing. First Officer was also
not happy but said nothing Despite [good] visual conditions, crew did not look out and see that
current heading would not bring them to the airfield.” Finally the plane's radar picks up the
mistake, and then comes the key sentence: “Captain hit First Officer with the back of his hand
for making the error.”
Hit him with the hack of his hand?
When the three pilots all met that evening at Kimpo for their preflight preparation, the first
officer and the engineer would have bowed to the captain. They would all have then shaken
hands. “Cheo eom hoeh seom ni da,” the copilot might have said, respectfully. “It is first time to
meet you.” The Korean language has no fewer than six different levels of conversational
address, depending on the relationship between the addressee and the addresser: formal
deference, informal deference, blunt, familiar, intimate, and plain. The first officer would not
have dared to use one of the more intimate or familiar forms when he addressed the captain.
This is a culture in which enormous attention is paid to the relative standing of any two people
in a conversation.
The Korean linguist Ho-min Sohn writes:
At a dinner table, a lower-ranking person must wait until a higher-ranking person sits down and
starts eating, while the reverse does not hold true; one does not smoke in the presence of a
social superior; when drinking with a social superior, the subordinate hides his glass and turns
away from the superior;... in greeting a social superior (though not an inferior) a Korean must
bow; a Korean must rise when an obvious social superior appears on the scene, and he cannot
pass in front of an obvious social superior. All social behavior and actions are conducted in the
order of seniority or ranking; as the saying goes, chanmul to wi alay ka issta, there is order even
to drinking cold water.
So, when the first officer says, “Don't you think it rains moreIn this area, here?” we know what
he means by that: Captain. You have committed us to visual approach, with no backup plan,
and the weather outside is terrible. You think that we will break out of the clouds in time to see
the runway. But what if we don'tIt's pitch-black outside and pouring rain and the glide scope is
down.
But he can't say that. He hints, and in his mind he's said as much as he can to a superior. The
first officer will not mention the weather again.
It is just after that moment that the plane, briefly, breaks out of the clouds, and off in the
Page 94/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
distance the pilots see lights.
“Is it Guam?” the flight engineer asks. Then, after a pause, he says, “It's Guam, Guam.”
The captain chuckles. “Good!”
But it isn't good. It's an illusion. They've come out of the clouds for a moment. But they are still
twenty miles from the airport, and there is an enormous amount of bad weather still ahead of
them. The flight engineer knows this, because it is his responsibility to track the weather, so
now he decides to speak up.
“Captain, the weather radar has helped us a lot,” he says.
The weather radar has helped us a lotA second hint from the flight deck. What the engineer
means is just what the first officer meant. This isn't a night where you can rely on just your eyes
to land the plane. Look at what the weather radar is telling us: there's trouble ahead.
To W estern ears, it seems strange that the flight engineer would bring up this subject just once.
Western communication has what linguists call a “transmitter orientation”that is, it is considered
the responsibility of the speaker to communicate ideas clearly and unambiguously. Even in the
tragic case of the Air Florida crash, where the first officer never does more than hint about the
danger posed by the ice, he still hints four times, phrasing his comments four different ways, in
an attempt to make his meaning clear. He may have been constrained by the power distance
between himself and the captain, but he was still operating within a W estern cultural context,
which holds that if there is confusion, it is the fault of the speaker.
But Korea, like many Asian countries, is receiver oriented. It is up to the listener to make sense
of what is being said. In the engineer's mind, he has said a lot.
Sohn gives the following conversation as an illustration, an exchange between an employee (Mr.
Kim) and his boss, a division chief (kwacang).
KWACANG: It's cold and I'm kind of hungry. [MEANING: Why don't you buy a drink or
something to eat?] MR. KIM: How about having a glass of liquor[MEANING: I will buy liquor for
you.] KWACANG: It's okay. Don't bother. [MEANING: I will accept your offer if you repeat it.]
MR. KIM:Youmustbehungry.How aboutgoing out[MEANING: I insist upon treating you.]
KWACANG: Shall I do so[MEANING: I accept.]
There is something beautiful in the subtlety of that exchange, in the attention that each party
must pay to the motivations and desires of the other. It is civilized, in the truest sense of that
word: it does not permit insensitivity or indifference.
But high-power distance communication works only when the listener is capable of paying close
attention, and it works only if the two parties in a conversation have the luxury of time, in order
to unwind each other's meanings. It doesn't work in an airplane cockpit on a stormy night with
an exhausted pilot trying to land at an airport with a broken glide scope.
13.
In 2000, Korean Air finally acted, bringing in an outsider from Delta Air Lines, David
Page 95/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Greenberg, to run their flight operations.
Greenberg's first step was something that would make no sense if you did not understand the
true roots of Korean Air's problems. He evaluated the English language skills of all of the
airline's flight crews. “Some of them were fine and some of them weren't,” he remembers. “So
we set up a program to assist and improve the proficiency of aviation English.” His second step
was to bring in a Western firma subsidiary of Boeing called Alteonto take over the company's
training and instruction programs. “Alteon conducted their training in English,” Greenberg says.
“They didn't speak Korean.” Greenberg's rule was simple. The new language of Korean Air was
English, and if you wanted to remain a pilot at the company, you had to be fluent in that
language. “This was not a purge,” he says. “Everyone had the same opportunity, and those who
found the language issue challenging were allowed to go out and study on their own nickel. But
language was the filter. I can't recall that anyone was fired for flying proficiency shortcomings.”
Greenberg's rationale was that English was the language of the aviation world. When the pilots
sat in the cockpit and worked their way through the written checklists that flight crews follow on
every significant point of procedure, those checklists were in English. When they talked to Air
Traffic Control anywhere in the world, those conversations would be in English.
“If you are trying to land at JFK at rush hour, there is no nonverbal communication,“ Greenberg
says. ”It's people talking to people, so you need to be darn sure you understand what's going
on. You can say that two Koreans side by side don't need to speak English. But if they are
arguing about what the guys outside said in English, then language is important.”
Greenberg wanted to give his pilots an alternate identity. Their problem was that they were
trapped in roles dictated by the heavy weight of their country's cultural legacy. They needed an
opportunity to step outside those roles when they sat in the cockpit, and language was the key
to that transformation. In English, they would be free of the sharply denned gradients of Korean
hierarchy: formal deference, informal deference, blunt, familiar, intimate, and plain. Instead, the
pilots could participate in a culture and language with a very different legacy.
The crucial part of Greenberg's reform, however, is what he didn't do. He didn't throw up his
hands in despair. He didn't fire all of his Korean pilots and start again with pilots from a lowpower distance culture. He knew that cultural legacies matterthat they are powerful and
pervasive and that they persist, long after their original usefulness has passed. But he didn't
assume that legacies are an indelible part of who we are. He believed that if the Koreans were
honest about where they came from and were willing to confront those aspects of their heritage
that did not suit the aviation world, they could change. He offered his pilots what everyone from
hockey players to software tycoons to takeover lawyers has been offered on the way to success:
an opportunity to transform their relationship to their work.
After leaving Korean Air, Greenberg helped start up a freight airline called Cargo 360, and he
took a number of Korean pilots with him. They were all flight engineers, who had been number
three, after the captain and first officer, in the strict hierarchy of the original Korean Air. “These
were guys who had performed in the old environment at Korean Air for as much as fifteen to
eighteen years,” he said. “They had accepted that subservient role. They had been at the
bottom of the ladder. We retrained them and put them with Western crew. They've been a
great success. They all changed their style. They take initiative. They pull their share of the load.
Page 96/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
They don't wait for someone to direct them. These are senior people, in their fifties, with a long
history in one context, who have been retrained and are now successful doing their job in a
Western cockpit. We took them out of their culture and re-normed them.”
That is an extraordinarily liberating example. When we understand what it really means to be a
good pilotwhen we understand how much culture and history and the world outside of the
individual matter to professional successthen we don't have to throw up our hands in despair at
an airline where pilots crash planes into the sides of mountains. We have a way to make
successes out of the unsuccessful.
But first we have to be frank about a subject that we would all too often rather ignore. In 1994,
when Boeing first published safety data showing a clear correlation between a country's plane
crashes and its score on Hofstede's Dimensions, the company's researchers practi cally tied
themselves in knots trying not to cause offense. “We're not saying there's anything here, but we
think there's something there” is how Boeing's chief engineer for airplane safety put it. Why are
we so squeamishWhy is the fact that each of us comes from a culture with its own distinctive mix
of strengths and weaknesses, tendencies and predispositions, so difficult to acknowledgeWho we
are cannot be separated from where we're fromand when we ignore that fact, planes crash.
14.
Back to the cockpit. “Captain, the weather radar has helped us a lot.” No pilot would say that
now. But this was in 1997, before Korean Air took its power distance issues seriously. The
captain was tired, and the engineer's true meaning sailed over the captain's head.
“Yes,” the captain says in response. “They are very useful.” He isn't listening.
The plane is flying toward the V O R beacon and the VOR is on the side of a mountain. The
weather hasn't broken. So the pilots can't see anything. The captain puts the landing gear down
and extends the flaps.
At 1:41:48, the captain says, “Wiper on,” and the flight engineer turns the wipers on. It's
raining now.
At 1:41:59, the first officer asks, “Not in sight?” He's looking for the runway. He can't see it.
He's had a sinking feeling in his stomach for some time now. One second later, the Ground
Proximity Warning System calls out in its toneless electronic voice, “Five hundred [feet].” The
plane is five hundred feet off the ground. The ground in this case is the side of Nimitz Hill. But
the crew is confused because they think that the ground means the runway, and how can that be
if they can't see the runwayThe flight engineer says, “ E h ” in an astonished tone of voice. You
can imagine them all thinking furiously, trying to square their assumption of where the plane is
with what their instruments are telling them.
At 1:42:19, the first officer says, “Let's make a missed approach.” He has finally upgraded from
a hint to a crew obligation: he wants to abort the landing. Later, in the crash investigation, it was
determined that if he had seized control of the plane in that moment, there would have been
enough time to pull up the nose and clear Nimitz Hill. That is what first officers are trained to do
when they believe a captain is clearly in the wrong. But it is one thing to learn that in a
classroom, and quite another to actually do it in the air, with someone who might rap you with
Page 97/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
the back of his hand if you make a mistake.
1:42:20. FLIGHT ENGINEER: Not in sight.
With disaster staring them in the face, both the first officer and the engineer have finally spoken
up. They want the captain to go around, to pull up and start the landing over again. But it's too
late.
1:42:21. FIRST OFFICER: Not in sight, missed approach.
1:42:22. FLIGHT ENGINEER: GO around.
1:42:23. CAPTAIN: Go around.
1:42:24:05. GROUND PROXIMITY W ARNING SYSTEM (GPWS): One hundred.

CHAPTER EIGHT
Rice Paddies and Math Tests “NO ONE WHO CAN RISE BEFORE DAWN THREE
HUNDRED SIXTY DAYS A YEAR FAILS TO MAKE HIS FAMILY RICH.”
1.
The gateway to the industrial heartland of Southern China runs up through the wide, verdant
swath of the Pearl River Delta. The land is covered by a thick, smoggy haze. The freeways are
crammed with tractor trailers. Power lines crisscross the landscape. Factories making cameras,
computers, watches, umbrellas, and T-shirts stand cheek by jowl with densely packed blocks of
apartment buildings and fields of banana and mango trees, sugarcane, papaya, and pineapple
destined for the export market. Few landscapes in the world have changed so much in so short
a time. A generation ago, the skies would have been clear and the road would have been a twolane highway. And a generation before that, all you would have seen were rice paddies.
Two hours in, at the headwaters of the Pearl River, lies the city of Guangzhou, and past
Guangzhou, remnants of the old China are easier to find. The countryside becomes
breathtakingly beautiful, rolling hills dotted with outcroppings of limestone rock against the
backdrop of the Nan Ling Mountains. Here and there are the traditional khaki-colored mud-brick
huts of the Chinese peasantry. In the small towns, there are open-air markets: chickens and
geese in elaborate bamboo baskets, vegetables laid out in rows on the ground, slabs of pork on
tables, tobacco being sold in big clumps. And everywhere, there is rice, miles upon miles of it. In
the winter season, the paddies are dry and dotted with the stubble of the previous year's crop.
After the crops are planted in early spring, as the humid winds begin to blow, they turn a
magical green, and by the time of the first harvest, as the grains emerge on the ends of the rice
shoots, the land becomes an unending sea ofyellow.
Rice has been cultivated in China for thousands of years. It was from China that the techniques
of rice cultivation spread throughout East AsiaJapan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Year in,
year out, as far back as history is recorded, farmers from across Asia have engaged in the same
relentless, intricate pattern of agriculture.
Rice paddies are “built,” not “opened up” the way a wheat field is. You don't just clear the
trees, underbrush, and stones and then plow. Rice fields are carved into mountainsides in an
elaborate series of terraces, or painstakingly constructed from marshland and river plains. A rice
paddy has to be irrigated, so a complex system of dikes has to be built around the field.
Channels must be dug from the nearest water source, and gates built into the dikes so the water
flow can be adjusted precisely to cover the right amount of the plant.
The paddy itself, meanwhile, has to have a hard clay floor; otherwise the water will simply seep
into the ground. But of course, rice seedlings can't be planted in hard clay, so on top of the clay,
there has to be a thick, soft layer of mud. And the claypan, as it's called, has to be carefully
engineered so that it will drain properly and also keep the plants submerged at the optimum
level. Rice has to be fertilized repeatedly, which is another art. Traditionally, farmers used “night
Page 99/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
soil” (human manure) and a combination of burned compost, river mud, bean cake, and hemp
and they had to be careful, because too much fertilizer, or the right amount applied at the wrong
time, could be as bad as too little.
When the time came to plant, a Chinese farmer would have hundreds of different varieties of
rice from which to choose, each one of which offered a slightly different trade-off, say, between
yield and how quickly it grew, or how well it did in times of drought, or how it fared in poor soil.
A farmer might plant a dozen or more different varieties at one time, adjusting the mix from
season to season in order to manage the risk of a crop failure.
He or she (or, more accurately, the whole family, since rice agriculture was a family affair) would
plant the seed in a specially prepared seedbed. After a few weeks, the seedlings would be
transplanted into the field, in carefully spaced rows six inches apart, and then painstakingly
nurtured.
Weeding was done by hand, diligently and unceasingly, because the seedlings could easily be choked by other plant life. Sometimes each rice
shoot would be individually groomed with a bamboo comb to clear away insects. All the while,
farmers had to check and recheck water levels and make sure the water didn't get too hot in the
summer sun. And when the rice ripened, farmers gathered all of their friends and relatives and,
in one coordinated burst, harvested it as quickly as possible so they could get a second crop in
before the winter dry season began.
Breakfast in South China, at least for those who could afford it, was congeewhite rice porridge
with lettuce and dace paste and bamboo shoots. Lunch was more congee. Dinner was rice with
“toppings.” Rice was what you sold at the market to buy the other necessities of life. It was how
wealth and status were measured. It dictated almost every working moment of every day. “Rice
is life,” says the anthropologist Gonealo Santos, who has studied a traditional South Chinese
village. “Without rice, you don't survive. If you want to be anyone in this part of China, you
would have to have rice. It made the world go around.”
2.
Take a look at the following list of numbers: 4, 8, 5,3, 9, 7, 6. Read them out loud. Now look
away and spend twenty seconds memorizing that sequence before saying them out loud again.
If you speak English, you have about a 50 percent chance of remembering that sequence
perfectly. If you're Chinese, though, you're almost certain to get it right every time. Why is
thatBecause as human beings we store digits in a memory loop that runs for about two seconds.
We most easily memorize whatever we can say or read within that two-second span. And
Chinese speakers get that list of numbers4, 8, 5, 3, 9, 7, 6right almost every time because,
unlike English, their language allows them to fit all those seven numbers into two seconds.
That example comes from Stanislas Dehaene's book The Number Sense. As Dehaene explains:
Chinese number words are remarkably brief. Most of them can be uttered in less than onequarter of a second (for instance, 4 is “si” and 7 “qi”). Their English equivalents “four,” “seven”
are longer: pronouncing them takes about one-third of a second. The memory gap between
Page 100/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
English and Chinese apparently is entirely due to this difference in length. In languages as
diverse as Welsh, Arabic, Chinese, English and Hebrew, there is a reproducible correlation
between the time required to pronounce numbers in a given language and the memory span of
its speakers. In this domain, the prize for efficacy goes to the Cantonese dialect of Chinese,
whose brevity grants residents of Hong Kong a rocketing memory span of about 10 digits.
It turns out that there is also a big difference in how number-naming systems in Western and
Asian languages are constructed. In English, we say fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, and
nineteen, so one might expect that we would also say oneteen, twoteen, threeteen, and
fiveteen. But we don't. W e use a different form: eleven, twelve, thirteen, and fifteen. Similarly,
we have forty and sixty,
which sound like the words they are related to (four and six). But we also say fifty and thirty and
twenty, which sort of sound like five and three and two, but not really. And, for that matter, for
numbers above twenty, we put the “decade” first and the unit number second (twentyone,
twenty-two), whereas for the teens, we do it the other way around (fourteen, seventeen,
eighteen). The number system in English is highly irregular. Not so in China, Japan, and Korea.
They have a logical counting system. Eleven is ten-one. Twelve is ten-two. Twenty-four is
twotens-four and so on.
That difference means that Asian children learn to count much faster than American children.
Four-year-old Chinese children can count, on average, to forty. American children at that age
can count only to fifteen, and most don't reach forty until they're five. By the age of five, in
other words, American children are already a year behind their Asian counterparts in the most
fundamental of math skills.
The regularity of their number system also means that Asian children can perform basic
functions, such as addition, far more easily. Ask an English-speaking seven-yearold to add thirtyseven plus twenty-two in her head, and she has to convert the words to numbers (37 + 22).
Only then can she do the math: 2 plus 7 is 9 and 30 and 20 is 50, which makes 59. Ask an
Asian child to add three-tensseven and two-tens-two, and then the necessary equa tion is right
there, embedded in the sentence. N o number translation is necessary: It's five-tens-nine.
“The Asian system is transparent,” says Karen Fuson, a Northwestern University psychologist
who has closely studied Asian-Western differences. “I think that it makes the whole attitude
toward math different. Instead of being a rote learning thing, there's a pattern I can figure out.
There is an expectation that I can do this. There is an expectation that it's sensible. For
fractions, we say three-fifths. The Chinese is literally 'out of five parts, take three.' That's telling
you conceptually what a fraction is. It's differentiating the denominator and the numerator.”
The much-storied disenchantment with mathematics among Western children starts in the third
and fourth grades, and Fuson argues that perhaps a part of that disenchantment is due to the
fact that math doesn't seem to make sense; its linguistic structure is clumsy; its basic rules seem
arbitrary and complicated.
Asian children, by contrast, don't feel nearly that same bafflement. They can hold more
numbers in their heads and do calculations faster, and the way fractions are expressed in their
languages corresponds exactly to the way a fraction actually isand maybe that makes them a
Page 101/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
little more likely to enjoy math, and maybe because they enjoy math a little more, they try a
little harder and take more math classes and are more willing to do their home work, and on
and on, in a kind of virtuous circle.
When it comes to math, in other words, Asians have a built-in advantage. But it's an unusual
kind of advantage. For years, students from China, South Korea, and Japanand the children of
recent immigrants who are from those countrieshave substantially outperformed their Western
counterparts at mathematics, and the typical assumption is that it has something to do with a
kind of innate Asian proclivity for math.* The psychologist Richard Lynn has even gone so far as
to propose an elaborate evolutionary theory involving the Himalayas, really cold weather,
premodern hunting practices, brain size, and specialized vowel sounds to explain why Asians
have higher IQs.1" That's how we think about math. We assume that being good at things like
calculus and algebra is a simple function of how smart someone is. But the differences between
the number systems in the East and the West suggest something very differentthat being good at
math may also be rooted in a group's culture.
In the case of the Koreans, one kind of deeply rooted legacy stood in the way of the very
modern task of flying an airplane. Here we have another kind of legacy, one that turns out to be
perfectly suited for twenty-first-century tasks. Cultural legacies matter, and once we've seen the
* On international comparison tests, students from Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore,
and Taiwan all score roughly the same in math, around the ninety-eighth percentile. The United
States, France, England, Germany, and the other Western industrialized nations cluster at
somewhere between the twenty-six and thirty-sixth percentile. That's a big difference.
“I” Lynn's claim that Asians have higher IQs has been refuted, convincingly, by a number of
other experts, who showed that he based his argument on IQ samples drawn disproportionately
from urban, upper-income homes. James Flynn, perhaps the world's leading expert on IQ, has
subsequently made a fascinating counterclaim. Asians' IQs, he says, have historically been
slightly lower than whites' IQs, meaning that their dominance in math has been in spite of their
IQ, not because of it. Flynn's argument was outlined in his book Asian Americans: Achievement
Beyond IQ (1991).
surprising effects of such things as power distance and numbers that can be said in a quarter as
opposed to a third of a second, it's hard not to wonder how many other cul tural legacies have
an impact on our twenty-first-century intellectual tasks. What if coming from a culture shaped by
the demands of growing rice also makes you better at math Could the rice paddy make a
difference in the classroom?
3.
The most striking fact about a rice paddywhich can never quite be grasped until you actually
stand in the middle of oneis its size. It's tiny. The typical rice paddy is about as big as a hotel
room. A typical Asian rice farm might be composed of two or three paddies. A village in China
of fifteen hundred people might support itself entirely with 450 acres of land, which in the
American Midwest would be the size of a typical family farm. At that scale, with families of five
and six people living off a farm the size of two hotel rooms, agriculture changes dramatically.
Historically, Western agriculture is “mechanically” oriented. In the W est, if a farmer wanted to
Page 102/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
become more efficient or increase his yield, he introduced more and more sophisticated
equipment, which allowed him to replace human labor with mechanical labor: a threshing
machine, a hay baler, a combine harvester, a tractor. He cleared another field and increased his
acreage, because now his machinery allowed him to work more land with the same amount of
effort. But in Japan or China, farmers didn't have the money to buy equipmentand, in any case, there certainly wasn't any extra
land that could easily be converted into new fields. So rice farmers improved their yields by
becoming smarter, by being better managers of their own time, and by making better choices.
As the anthropologist Francesca Bray puts it, rice agriculture is “skill oriented”: if you're willing
to weed a bit more diligently, and become more adept at fertilizing, and spend a bit more time
monitoring water levels, and do a better job keeping the claypan absolutely level, and make use
of every square inch of your rice paddy, you'll harvest a bigger crop. Throughout history, not
surprisingly, the people who grow rice have always worked harder than almost any other kind of
farmer.
That last statement may seem a little odd, because most of us have a sense that everyone in the
premodern world worked really hard. But that simply isn't true. All of us, for example, are
descended at some point from huntergatherers, and many hunter-gatherers, by all accounts, had
a pretty leisurely life. The !Kung bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, in Botswana, who are one of
the last remaining practitioners of that way of life, subsist on a rich assortment of fruits, berries,
roots, and nutsin particular the mongongo nut, an incredibly plentiful and protein-rich source of
food that lies thick on the ground. They don't grow anything, and it is growing thingspreparing,
planting, weeding, harvesting, storingthat takes time. Nor do they raise any animals.
Occasionally, the male !Kung hunt, but chiefly for sport. All told, !Kung men and women work
no more than about twelve to nineteen hours a week, with the balance of the time spent
dancing, entertaining, and visiting family and friends. That's, at most, one thousand hours of
work a year. (When a bushman was asked once why his people hadn't taken to agriculture, he
looked puzzled and said, “Why should we plant, when there are so many mongongo nuts in the
world?”)
Or consider the life of a peasant in eighteenth-century Europe. Men and women in those days
probably worked from dawn to noon two hundred days a year, which works out to about twelve
hundred hours of work annually. During harvest or spring planting, the day might be longer. In
the winter, much less. In The Discovery of France, the historian Graham Robb argues that
peasant life in a country like France, even well into the nineteenth century, was essentially brief
episodes of work followed by long peri ods of idleness.
“Ninety-nine percent of all human activity described in this and other accounts [of French
country life],” he writes, “took place between late spring and early autumn.” In the Pyrenees
and the Alps, entire villages would essentially hibernate from the time of the first snow in
November until March or April. In more temperate regions of France, where temperatures in
the winter rarely fell below freezing, the same pattern held. Robb continues:
The fields of Flanders were deserted for much of the year. An official report on the Nievre in
1844 described the strange mutation of the Burgundian day-laborer once the harvest was in and
the vine stocks had been burned: “After making the necessary repairs to their tools, these
vigorous men will now spend their days in bed, packing their bodies tightly together in order to
Page 103/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
stay warm and eat less food. They weaken themselves deliberately.”
Human hibernation was a physical and economic necessity. Lowering the metabolic rate
prevented hunger from exhausting supplies People trudged and dawdled, even in summer After
the revolution, in Alsace and the Pas-de-Calais, officials complained that wine growers and
independent farmers, instead of undertaking “some peaceful and sedentary industry” in the
quieter season, “abandon themselves to dumb idleness.”
If you were a peasant farmer in Southern China, by contrast, you didn't sleep through the
winter. In the short break marked by the dry season, from November through February, you
busied yourself with side tasks. You made bamboo baskets or hats and sold them in the market.
You repaired the dikes in your rice paddy, and rebuilt your mud hut. You sent one of your sons
to work in a nearby village for a relative. You made tofu and dried bean curd and caught snakes
(they were a delicacy) and trapped insects. By the time lahp cheun (the “turning of the spring”)
came, you were back in the fields at dawn. Working in a rice field is ten to twenty times more
labor-intensive than working on an equivalent-size corn or wheat field. Some estimates put the
annual workload of a wet-rice farmer in Asia at three thousand hours a year.
4.
Think, for a moment, about what the life of a rice farmer in the Pearl River Delta must have
been like. Three thousand hours a year is a staggering amount of time to spend working,
particularly if many of those hours involve being bent over in the hot sun, planting and weeding
in a rice paddy.
What redeemed the life of a rice farmer, however, was the nature of that work. It was a lot like
the garment work done by the Jewish immigrants to New York. It was meaningful. First of all,
there is a clear relationship in rice farming between effort and reward. The harder you work a
rice field, the more it yields. Second, it's complex work. The rice farmer isn't simply planting in
the spring and harvesting in the fall. He or she effectively runs a small business, juggling a family
workforce, hedging uncertainty through seed selection, building and managing a sophisticated
irrigation system, and coordinating the complicated process of harvesting the first crop while
simultaneously preparing the second crop.
And, most of all, it's autonomous. The peasants of Europe worked essentially as low-paid slaves
of an aristocratic landlord, with little control over their own destinies. But China and Japan
never developed that kind of oppressive feudal system, because feudalism simply can't work in a
rice economy. Growing rice is too complicated and intricate for a system that requires farmers
to be coerced and bullied into going out into the fields each morning. By the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, landlords in central and Southern China had an almost completely hands-off
relationship with their tenants: they would collect a fixed rent and let farmers go about their
business.
“The thing about wet-rice farming is, not only do you need phenomenal amounts of labor, but
it's very exacting,“ says the historian Kenneth Pomerantz. ”You have to care. It really matters
that the field is perfectly leveled before you flood it. Getting it close to level but not quite right
makes a big difference in terms of your yield. It really matters that the water is in the fields for
just the right amount of time. There's a big difference between lining up the seedlings at exactly
Page 104/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
the right distance and doing it sloppily. It's not like you put the corn in the ground in mid-March
and as long as rain comes by the end of the month, you're okay. You're controlling all the inputs
in a very direct way. And when you have something that requires that much care, the overlord
has to have a system that gives the actual laborer some set of incentives, where if the harvest
comes out well, the farmer gets a bigger share. That's why you get fixed rents, where the
landlord says, I get twenty bushels, regardless of the harvest, and if it's really good, you get the
extra. It's a crop that doesn't do very well with something like slavery or wage labor. It would just
be too easy to leave the gate that controls the irrigation water open a few seconds too long and
there goes your field.”
The historian David Arkush once compared Russian and Chinese peasant proverbs, and the
differences are striking. “If God does not bring it, the earth will not give it” is a typical Russian
proverb. That's the kind of fatalism and pessimism typical of a repressive feudal system, where
peasants have no reason to believe in the efficacy of their own work. On the other hand,
Arkush writes, Chinese proverbs are striking in their belief that "hard work,
shrewd planning and self-reliance or cooperation with a small group will in time bring
recompense."
Here are some of the things that penniless peasants would say to one another as they worked
three thousand hours a year in the baking heat and humidity of Chinese rice paddies (which, by
the way, are filled with leeches):
“No food without blood and sweat.” “Farmers are busy; farmers are busy; if farmers weren't
busy, where would grain to get through the winter come from?“ ”In winter, the lazy man freezes
to death.“ ”Don't depend on heaven for food, but on your own two hands carrying the load.“
”Useless to ask about the crops, it all depends on hard work and fertilizer.“ ”If a man works
hard, the land will not be lazy.”
And, most telling of all: “No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails
to make his family rich.” Rise before dawn360 days a yearFor the !Kung leisurely gathering
mongongo nuts, or the French peasant sleeping away the winter, or anyone else living in
something other than the world of rice cultivation, that proverb would be unthinkable.
This is not, of course, an unfamiliar observation about Asian culture. Go to any Western college
campus and you'll find that Asian students have a reputation for being in the library long after
everyone else has left. Sometimes people of Asian background get offended when their culture
is described this way, because they think that the stereotype is being used as a form of
disparagement. But a belief in work ought to be a thing of beauty. Virtually every success story
we've seen in this book so far involves someone or some group working harder than their
peers. Bill Gates was addicted to his computer as a child. So was Bill Joy. The Beatles put in
thousands of hours of practice in Hamburg. Joe Flom ground away for years, perfecting the art
of takeovers, before he got his chance. Working really hard is what successful people do, and
the genius of the culture formed in the rice paddies is that hard work gave those in the fields a
way to find meaning in the midst of great uncertainty and poverty. That lesson has served
Asians well in many endeavors but rarely so perfectly as in the case of mathematics.

Page 105/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
A few years ago, Alan Schoenfeld, a math professor at Berkeley, made a videotape of a woman
named Renee as she was trying to solve a math problem. Renee was in her mid-twenties, with
long black hair and round silver glasses. In the tape, she's playing with a software program
designed to teach algebra. On the screen are a y and an x axis. The program asks the user to
punch in a set of coordinates and then draws the line from those coordinates on the screen. For
example, when she typed in 5on the y axis and 5on the x axis, the computer did this:
At this point, I'm sure, some vague memory of your middle-school algebra is coming back to
you. But rest assured, you don't need to remember any of it to understand the significance of
Renee's example. In fact, as you listen to Renee talking in the next few paragraphs, focus not
on what she's saying but rather on how she's talking and why she's talking the way she is.
The point of the computer program, which Schoenfeld created, was to teach students about
how to calculate the slope of a line. Slope, as I'm sure you remember (or, more accurately, as I'll
bet you don't remember; I certainly didn't), is rise over run. The slope of the line in our example
is i, since the rise is 5 and the run is 5.
So there is Renee. She's sitting at the keyboard, and she's trying to figure out what numbers to
enter in order to get the computer to draw a line that is absolutely verti cal, that is directly
superimposed over the y axis. Now, those of you who remember your high school math will
know that this is, in fact, impossible. A vertical line has an undefined slope. Its rise is infinite:
any number on the y axis starting at zero and going on forever. It's run on the x axis,
meanwhile, is zero. Infinity divided by zero is not a number.
But Renee doesn't realize that what she's trying to do can't be done. She is, rather, in the grip
of what Schoenfeld calls a “glorious misconception,” and the reason Schoenfeld likes to show
this particular tape is that it is a perfect demonstration of how this misconception came to be
resolved.
Renee was a nurse. She wasn't someone who had been particularly interested in mathematics in
the past. But she had somehow gotten hold of the software and was hooked.
“Now, what I want to do is make a straight line with this formula, parallel to the y axis,” she
begins. Schoenfeld is sitting next to her. She looks over at him anxiously. “It's been five years
since I did any of this.”
She starts to fiddle with the program, typing in different numbers.
“Now if I change the slope that way...minus i... now what I mean to do is make the line go
straight.”
As she types in numbers, the line on the screen changes.
“Oops. That's not going to do it.” She looks puzzled. “What are you trying to do?” Schoenfeld
asks. "What I'm trying to do is make a straight line par?
allel to the y axis. What do I need to do hereI think what I need to do is change this a little bit.“
She points at the place where the number for the y axis is. ”That was something I discovered.
That when you go from i to 2,
Page 106/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
there was a rather big change. But now if you get way up there you have to keep changing."
This is Renee's glorious misconception. She's noticed the higher she makes the y axis
coordinate, the steeper the line gets. So she thinks the key to making a vertical line is just
making the y axis coordinate large enough.
“I guess 12 or even 13 could do it. Maybe even as much as 15.”
She frowns. She and Schoenfeld go back and forth. She asks him questions. He prods her
gently in the right direction. She keeps trying and trying, one approach after another.
At one point, she types in 20. The line gets a little bit steeper.
RICE PADDIES AND MATH TESTS She types in 40. The line gets steeper still. y “I see that
there is a relationship there. But as to why, it doesn't seem to make sense to me What if I do
80?If 40 gets me halfway, then 80 should get me all the way to the y axis. So let's just see what
happens.”
She types in 80. The line is steeper. But it's still not totally vertical.
“Ohhh. It's infinity, isn't itIt's never going to get there.” Renee is close. But then she reverts to
her original misconception.
“So what do I need100Every time you double the number, you get halfway to the y axis. But it
never gets there...”
She types in 100.
“It's closer. But not quite there yet.”
She starts to think out loud. It's obvious she's on the verge of figuring something out. “Well, I
knew this, though... but... I knew that. For each one up, it goes that many over. I'm still
somewhat confused as to why...”
She pauses, squinting at the screen.
“I'm getting confused. It's a tenth of the way to the one. But I don't want it to be...”
And then she sees it.
“Oh! It's any number up, and zero over. It's any number divided by zero!” Her face lights up. “A
vertical line is anything divided by zero and that's an undefined number. Ohhh. Okay. Now I
see. The slope of a vertical line is undefined. Ahhhh. That means something now. I won't forget
that!”
6.
Over the course of his career, Schoenfeld has videotaped countless students as they worked on
math problems. But the Renee tape is one of his favorites because of how beautifully it
illustrates what he considers to be the secret to learning mathematics. Twenty-two minutes pass
from the moment Renee begins playing with the computer program to the moment she says,
“Ahhhh. That means something now.” That's a long time. “This is eighth-grade mathematics,”
Page 107/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Schoenfeld said. “ I f I put the average eighth grader in the same position as Renee, I'm
guessing that after the first few attempts, they would have said, T don't get it. I need you to
explain it.' ” Schoenfeld once asked a group of high school students how long they would work
on a homework question before they concluded it was too hard for them ever to solve. Their
answers ranged from thirty seconds to five minutes, with the average answer two minutes.
But Renee persists. She experiments. She goes back over the same issues time and again. She
thinks out loud. She keeps going and going. She simply won't give up. She knows on some
vague level that there is something wrong with her theory about how to draw a vertical line, and
she won't stop until she's absolutely sure she has it right.
Renee wasn't a math natural. Abstract concepts like “slope” and “undefined” clearly didn't come
easily to her. But Schoenfeld could not have found her more impressive.
“There's a will to make sense that drives what she does,” Schoenfeld says. “She wouldn't accept
a superficial 'Yeah, you're right' and walk away. That's not who she is. And that's really
unusual.” He rewound the tape and pointed to a moment when Renee reacted with genuine
surprise to something on the screen.
“Look,” he said. “She does a double take. Many students would just let that fly by. Instead, she
thought, 'That doesn't jibe with whatever I'm thinking. I don't get it. That's important. I want an
explanation.' And when she finally gets the explanation, she says, 'Yeah, that fits.' ”
At Berkeley, Schoenfeld teaches a course on problem solving, the entire point of which, he
says, is to get his students to unlearn the mathematical habits they picked up on the way to
university. “I pick a problem that I don't know how to solve,” he says. “I tell my students,
'You're going to have a two-week take-home exam. I know your habits. You're going to do
nothing for the first week and start it next week, and I want to warn you now: If you only spend
one week on this, you're not going to solve it. If, on the other hand, you start working the day I
give you the midterm, you'll be frustrated. You'll come to me and say, 'It's impossible.' I'll tell
you, Keep working, and by week two, you'll find you'll make significant progress.”
We sometimes think of being good at mathematics as an innate ability. You either have “it” or
you don't. But to Schoenfeld, it's not so much ability as attitude. You master mathematics if you
are willing to try. That's what Schoenfeld attempts to teach his students. Success is a function of
persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for twenty-two minutes to make
sense of something that most people would give up on after thirty seconds. Put a bunch of
Renees in a classroom, and give them the space and time to explore mathematics for
themselves, and you could go a long way. Or imagine a country where Renee's doggedness is
not the exception, but a cultural trait, embedded as deeply as the culture of honor in the
Cumberland Plateau. Now that would be a country good at math.
7.
Every four years, an international group of educators administers a comprehensive mathematics
and science test to elementary and junior high students around the world. It's the TIMSS (the
same test you read about earlier, in the discussion of differences between fourth graders born
near the beginning of a school cutoff date and those born near the end of the date), and the
point of the TIMSS is to compare the educational achievement of one country with another's.
Page 108/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
When students sit down to take the TIMSS exam, they also have to fill out a questionnaire. It
asks them all kinds of things, such as what their parents' level of education is, and what their
views about math are, and what their friends are like. It's not a trivial exercise. It's about 120
questions long. In fact, it is so tedious and demanding that many students leave as many as ten
or twenty questions blank.
Now, here's the interesting part. As it turns out, the average number of items answered on that
questionnaire varies from country to country. It is possible, in fact, to rank all the participating
countries according to how many items their students answer on the questionnaire. Now, what
do you think happens if you compare the questionnaire rankings with the math rankings on the
TIMSSThey are exactly the same. In other words, countries whose students are willing to
concentrate and sit still long enough and focus on answering every single question in an endless
questionnaire are the same countries whose students do the best job of solving math problems.
The person who discovered this fact is an educational researcher at the University of
Pennsylvania named Erling Boe, and he stumbled across it by accident. “It came out of the
blue,” he says. Boe hasn't even been able to publish his findings in a scientific journal, because,
he says, it's just a bit too weird. Remember, he's not saying that the ability to finish the
questionnaire and the ability to excel on the math test are related. He's saying that they are the
same: if you compare the two rankings, they are identical.
Think about this another way. Imagine that every year, there was a Math Olympics in some
fabulous city in the world. And every country in the world sent its own team of one thousand
eighth graders. Boe's point is that we could predict precisely the order in which every country
would finish in the Math Olympics without asking a single math question. All we would have to
do is give them some task measuring how hard they were willing to work. In fact, we wouldn't
even have to give them a task. We should be able to predict which countries are best at math
simply by looking at which national cultures place the highest emphasis on effort and hard work.
So, which places are at the top of both listsThe answer shouldn't surprise you: Singapore, South
Korea, China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, and Japan. What those five have in common, of course, is
that they are all cultures shaped by the tradition of wet-rice agriculture and meaningful work.*
They are the kinds of places where, for hundreds of years, penniless peasants, slaving away in
the rice paddies three thousand hours a year, said things to one another like “No one who can
rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich.”1'
* Two small points. Mainland China isn't on this list because China doesn't yet take part in the
TIMSS study. But the fact that Taiwan and Hong Kong rank so highly suggests that the mainland
would probably also do really well.
Second, and perhaps more important, what happens in the north of China, which isn't a wetrice agriculture society but historically a wheat-growing culture, much like Western EuropeAre
they good at math tooThe short answer is that we don't know. The psychologist James Flynn
points out, though, that the overwhelming majority of Chinese immigrants to the Westthe
people who have done so well in math hereare from South China. The Chinese students
graduating at the top of their class at MIT are the descendants, chiefly, of people from the Pearl
River Delta. He also points out that the lowest achieving Chinese Americans are the so-called
Page 109/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Sze Yap people, who come from the edges of the Delta, “where soil was less fertile and
agriculture less intense.” + There is actually a significant scientific literature measuring Asian
“persistence.” In a typical study, Priscilla Blinco gave large groups of
JapaneseandAmericanfirstgradersaverydifficultpuzzleandmeasured how long they worked at it
before they gave up. The American children lasted, on average, 9.47 minutes. The Japanese
children lasted 13.93 minutes, roughly 40 percent longer.

CHAPTER NINE
Marita's Bargain “ALL MY FRIENDS NOW ARE FROM KIPP.”
In the mid-1990s, an experimental public school called the KIPP Academy opened on the fourth
floor of Lou Gehrig Junior High School in New York City.“” Lou Gehrig is in the seventh school
district, otherwise known as the South Bronx, one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York
City. It is a squat, gray i96os-era building across the street from a bleak-looking group of highrises. A few blocks over is Grand Concourse, the borough's main thoroughfare. These are not
streets that you'd happily walk down,
alone, after dark. KIPP is a middle school. Classes are large: the fifth grade has two sections of
thirty-five students each. There are no entrance exams or admissions requirements. Students
are * KIPP stands for “Knowledge Is Power Program.” 250 chosen by lottery, with any fourth
grader living in the Bronx eligible to apply. Roughly half of the students are African American;
the rest are Hispanic. Three-quarters of the children come from single-parent homes. Ninety
percent qualify for “free or reduced lunch,” which is to say that their families earn so little that
the federal government chips in so the children can eat properly at lunchtime.
KIPP Academy seems like the kind of school in the kind of neighborhood with the kind of
student that would make educators despairexcept that the minute you enter the building, it's
clear that something is different. The students walk quietly down the hallways in single file. In
the classroom, they are taught to turn and address anyone talking to them in a protocol known
as “SSLANT”: smile, sit up, listen, ask questions, nod when being spoken to, and track with
your eyes. O n the walls of the school's corridors are hundreds of pennants from the colleges
that KIPP graduates have gone on to attend. Last year, hun dreds of families from across the
Bronx entered the lottery for KIPP's two fifth-grade classes. It is no exaggeration to say that just
over ten years into its existence, KIPP has become one of the most desirable public schools in
New York City.
What KIPP is most famous for is mathematics. In the South Bronx, only about 16percent of all
middle school students are performing at or above their grade level in math. But at KIPP, by the
end of fifth grade, many of the students call math their favorite subject. In seventh grade, KIPP
students start high school algebra. By the end of eighth grade, 84 percent of the students are
performing at or above their grade level, which is to say that this motley group of randomly chosen lower-income kids from dingy apartments in one of the country's worst
neighborhoodswhose parents, in an overwhelming number of cases, never set foot in a
collegedo as well in mathematics as the privileged eighth graders of American's wealthy suburbs.
“Our kids' reading is on point,” said David Levin, who founded KIPP with a fellow teacher,
Michael Feinberg, in 1994. “They struggle a little bit with writing skills. But when they leave
here, they rock in math.”
There are now more than fifty KIPP schools across the United States, with more on the way.
The KIPP program represents one of the most promising new educational philosophies in the
Page 111/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
United States. But its success is best understood not in terms of its curriculum, its teachers, its
resources, or some kind of institutional innovation. KIPP is, rather, an organization that has
succeeded by taking the idea of cultural legacies seriously.
In the early nineteenth century, a group of reformers set out to establish a system of public
education in the United States. What passed for public school at the time was a haphazard
assortment of locally run one-room schoolhouses and overcrowded urban classrooms scattered
around the country. In rural areas, schools closed in the spring and fall and ran all summer long,
so that children could help out in the busy planting and harvesting seasons. In the city, many
schools mirrored the long and chaotic schedules of the children's working-class parents. The
reformers wanted to make sure that all children went to school and that public school was
comprehensive, meaning that all children got enough schooling to learn how to read and write
and do basic arithmetic and function as productive citizens.
But as the historian Kenneth Gold has pointed out, the early educational reformers were also
tremendously concerned that children not get too much schooling. In 1871, for example, the
US commissioner of education published a report by Edward Jarvis on the “Relation of
Education to Insanity.” Jarvis had studied 1,741 cases of insanity and concluded that “overstudy” was responsible for 205of them. “Education lays the foundation of a large portion of the
causes of mental disorder,” Jarvis wrote. Similarly, the pioneer of public education in
Massachusetts, Horace Mann, believed that working students too hard would create a “most
pernicious influence upon character and habits Not infrequently is health itself destroyed by overstimulating the mind.” In the education journals of the day, there were constant worries about
overtaxing students or blunting their natural abilities through too much schoolwork.
The reformers, Gold writes:
strove for ways to reduce time spent studying, because long periods of respite could save the
mind from injury. Hence the elimination of Saturday classes, the shortening of the school day,
and the lengthening of vacationall of which occurred over the course of the nineteenth century.
Teachers were cautioned that “when [students] are required to study, their bodies should not be
exhausted by long confinement, nor their minds bewildered by prolonged application.” Rest also
presented particular opportunities for strengthening cognitive and analytical skills. As one
contributor to the Massachusetts Teacher suggested, “it is when thus relieved from the state of
tension belonging to actual study that boys and girls, as well as men and women, acquire the
habit of thought and reflection, and of forming their own conclusions, independently of what
they are taught and the authority of others.”
This ideathat effort must be balanced by rest could not be more different from Asian notions
about study and work, of course. But then again, the Asian worldview was shaped by the rice
paddy. In the Pearl River Delta, the rice farmer planted two and sometimes three crops a year.
The land was fallow only briefly. In fact, one of the singular features of rice cultivation is that
because of the nutrients carried by the water used in irrigation, the more a plot of land is
cultivated, the more fertile it gets.
But in W estern agriculture, the opposite is true. Unless a wheator cornfield is left fallow every
few years, the soil becomes exhausted. Every winter, fields are empty. The hard labor of spring
planting and fall harvesting is followed, like clockwork, by the slower pace of summer and

winter. This is the logic the reformers applied to the culti vation of young minds. We formulate
new ideas by analogy, working from what we know toward what we don't know, and what the
reformers knew were the rhythms of the agricultural seasons. A mind must be cultivated. But
not too much, lest it be exhausted. And what was the remedy for the dangers of exhaustionThe
long summer vacationa peculiar and distinctive American legacy that 3rd Grade 4th Grade 5th
Grade 397 433 461 425 467 497 460 506 534 has had profound consequences for the
learning patterns of the students of the present day.
Summer vacation is a topic seldom mentioned in American educational debates. It is considered
a permanent and inviolate feature of school life, like high school football or the senior prom. But
take a look at the following sets of elementary school test-score results, and see if your faith in
the value of long summer holidays isn't profoundly shaken.
These numbers come from research led by the Johns Hopkins University sociologist Karl
Alexander. Alexander tracked the progress of 650 first graders from the Baltimore public school
system, looking at how they scored on a widely used mathand reading-skills exam called the
California Achievement Test. These are reading scores for the first five years of elementary
school, broken down by socioeconomic class low, middle, and high.
Look at the first column. The students start in first grade with meaningful, but not
overwhelming, differences in their knowledge and ability. The first graders from the wealthiest
homes have a 32-point advantage over the first graders from the poorest homesand by the way,
first graders from poor homes in Baltimore are really poor. Now look at the fifth-grade column.
By that point, four years later, the initially modest gap between rich and poor has more than
doubled.
This “achievement gap” is a phenomenon that has been observed over and over again, and it
typically provokes one of two responses. The first response is that disadvantaged kids simply
don't have the same inherent ability to learn as children from more privileged backgrounds.
They're not as smart. The second, slightly more optimistic conclusion is that, in some way, our
schools are failing poor children: we simply aren't doing a good enough job of teaching them
the skills they need. But here's where Alexander's study gets interesting, because it turns out
that neither of those explanations rings true.
The city of Baltimore didn't give its kids the California Achievement Test just at the end of every
school year, in June. It gave them the test in September too, just after summer vacation ended.
What Alexander realized is that the second set of test results allowed him to do a slightly
different analysis. If he looked at the difference between the score a student got at the
beginning of the school year, in September, and the score he or she got the following June, he
could measurepreciselyhow much that student learned over the school year. And if he looked at
the difference between a student's score in June and then in the following September, he could
see how much that student learned over the course of the summer. In other words, he could
figure outat least in parthow much of the achievement gap is the result of things that happen 46
30 33 43 34 41 39 34 28 during the school year, and how much it has to do with what
happens during summer vacation.
Let's start with the school-year gains. This table shows how many points students' test scores
rose from the time they started classes in September to the time they stopped in June. The
Page 113/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
“Total” column represents their cumulative classroom learning from all five years of elementary
school.
Class 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Grade Grade Grade Grade 5th Total Grade 25 189 27 214 23 184 Here
is a completely different story from the one suggested by the first table. The first set of test
results made it look like lower-income kids were somehow failing in the classroom. But here we
see plainly that isn't true. Look at the “Total” column. Over the course of five years of
elementary school, poor kids “out-learn” the wealthiest kids 189 points to 184 points. They lag
behind the middle-class kids by only a modest amount, and, in fact, in one year, second grade,
they learn more than the middleor upper-class kids.
Next, let's see what happens if we look just at how reading scores change during summer
vacation.
Class After 1st After 2nd After 3rd After 4th Total Low -3.67 -1.70 2.74 2.89 0.26 Middle
-3.11 4.18 High 15.38 9.22 3.68 2.34 7.09 14.51 13.38 52.49 Do you see the
differenceLook at the first column, which measures what happens over the summer after first
grade. The wealthiest kids come back in September and their reading scores have jumped more
than 15 points. The poorest kids come back from the holidays and their reading scores have
dropped almost 4 points. Poor kids may out-learn rich kids during the school year. But during
the summer, they fall far behind.
Now take a look at the last column, which totals up all the summer gains from first grade to fifth
grade. The reading scores of the poor kids go up by .26 points. When it comes to reading skills,
poor kids learn nothing when school is not in session. The reading scores of the rich kids, by
contrast, go up by a whopping 52.49 points. Virtually all of the advantage that wealthy students
have over poor students is the result of differences in the way privileged kids learn while they
are not in school.
What are we seeing hereOne very real possibility is that these are the educational consequences
of the differences in parenting styles that we talked about in the Chris Langan chapter. Think
back to Alex Williams, the nine-year-old whom Annette Lareau studied. His parents believe in
concerted cultivation. He gets taken to museums and gets enrolled in special programs and goes
to summer camp, where he takes classes. When he's bored at home, there are plenty of books
to read, and his parents see it as their responsibility to keep him actively engaged in the world
around him. It's not hard to see how Alex would get better at reading and math over the
summer.
But not Katie Brindle, the little girl from the other side of the tracks. There's no money to send
her to summer camp. She's not getting driven by her mom to special classes, and there aren't
books lying around her house that she can read if she gets bored. There's probably just a tele
vision. She may still have a wonderful vacation, making new friends, playing outside, going to
the movies, having the kind of carefree summer days that we all dream about. None of those
things, though, will improve her math and reading skills, and every carefree summer day she
spends puts her further and further behind Alex. Alex isn't necessarily smarter than Katie. He's
just out-learning her: he's putting in a few solid months of learning during the summer while she
watches television and plays outside.
Page 114/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
What Alexander's work suggests is that the way in which education has been discussed in the
United States is backwards. An enormous amount of time is spent talking about reducing class
size, rewriting curricula, buying every student a shiny new laptop, and increasing school
fundingall of which assumes that there is something fundamentally wrong with the job schools
are doing. But look back at the second table, which shows what happens between September
and June. Schools work. The only problem with school, for the kids who aren't achieving, is that
there isn't enough of it.
Alexander, in fact, has done a very simple calculation to demonstrate what would happen if the
children of Baltimore went to school year-round. The answer is that poor kids and wealthy kids
would, by the end of elementary school, be doing math and reading at almost the same level.
Suddenly the causes of Asian math superiority become even more obvious. Students in Asian
schools don't have long summer vacations. Why would theyCultures that believe that the route
to success lies in rising before dawn 360 days a year are scarcely going to give their children
three straight months off in the summer. The school year in the United States is, on average,
180 days long. The South Korean school year is 220 days long. The Japanese school year is
243 days long.
One of the questions asked of test takers on a recent math test given to students around the
world was how many of the algebra, calculus, and geometry questions covered subject matter
that they had previously learned in class. For Japanese twelfth graders, the answer was 92
percent. That's the value of going to school 243 days a year. You have the time to learn
everything that needs to be learnedand you have less time to unlearn it. For American twelfth
graders, the comparable figure was 54 percent. For its poorest students, America doesn't have
a school problem. It has a summer vacation problem, and that's the problem the KIPP schools
set out to solve. They decided to bring the lessons of the rice paddy to the American inner city.
“They start school at seven twenty-five,” says David Levin of the students at the Bronx KIPP
Academy. "They all do a course called thinking skills until seven fifty-five. They do ninety
minutes of English, ninety minutes of math every day, except in fifth grade, where they do two
hours of math a day. A n hour of science, an hour of social science, an hour of music at least
twice a week, and then you have an hour and fifteen minutes of orchestra on top of that.
Everyone does orchestra. The day goes from seven twenty-five until five p.m. After five, there
are homework clubs, detention, sports teams. There are kids here from seven twenty-five until
seven p.m. If you take an average day, and you take out lunch and recess, our kids are spending
fifty to sixty percent more time learning than the traditional public school student/'
Levin was standing in the school's main hallway. It was lunchtime and the students were
trooping by quietly in orderly lines, all of them in their KIPP Academy shirts. Levin stopped a
girl whose shirttail was out. “Do me a favor, when you get a chance,” he called out, miming a
tucking-in movement. He continued: “Saturdays they come in nine to one. In the summer, it's
eight to two.” By summer, Levin was referring to the fact that KIPP stu dents do three extra
weeks of school, in July. These are, after all, precisely the kind of lower-income kids who
Alexander identified as losing ground over the long summer vacation, so KIPP's response is
simply to not have a long summer vacation.
“The beginning is hard,” he went on. “By the end of the day they're restless. Part of it is
Page 115/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
endurance, part of it is motivation. Part of it is incentives and rewards and fun stuff. Part of it is
good old-fashioned discipline. You throw all of that into the stew. W e talk a lot here about grit
and self-control. The kids know what those words mean.”
Levin walked down the hall to an eighth-grade math class and stood quietly in the back. A
student named Aaron was at the front of the class, working his way through a problem from the
page of thinking-skills exercises that all KIPP students are required to do each morning. The
teacher, a ponytailed man in his thirties named Frank Corcoran, sat in a chair to the side, only
occasionally jumping in to guide the discussion. It was the kind of scene repeated every day in
American classroomswith one difference. Aaron was up at the front, working on that single
problem, for twenty minutesmethodically, carefully, with the participation of the class, working
his way through not just the answer but also the question of whether there was more than one
way to get the answer. It was Renee painstakingly figuring out the concept of undefined slope all
over again.
“What that extra time does is allow for a more relaxed atmosphere,” Corcoran said, after the
class was over. “I find that the problem with math education is the sink-orswim approach.
Everything is rapid fire, and the kids who get it first are the ones who are rewarded. So there
comes to be a feeling that there are people who can do math and there are people who aren't
math people. I think that extended amount of time gives you the chance as a teacher to explain
things, and more time for the kids to sit and digest everything that's going onto review, to do
things at a much slower pace. It seems counterintuitive but we do things at a slower pace and as
a result we get through a lot more. There's a lot more retention, better understanding of the
material. It lets me be a little bit more relaxed. We have time to have games. Kids can ask any
questions they want, and if I'm explaining something, I don't feel pressed for time. I can go back
over material and not feel time pressure.” The extra time gave Corcoran the chance to make
mathematics meaningful: to let his students see the clear relationship between effort and
reward.
On the walls of the classroom were dozens of certificates from the New York State Regents
exam, testifying to first-class honors for Corcoran's students. “We had a girl in this class,”
Corcoran said. “She was a horrible math student in fifth grade. She cried every Saturday when
we did remedial stuff. Huge tears and tears.” At the memory, Corcoran got a little emotional
himself. He looked down. “She just e-mailed us a couple weeks ago. She's in college now. She's
an accounting major.”
The story of the miracle school that transforms losers into winners is, of course, all too familiar.
It's the stuff of inspirational books and sentimental Hollywood movies. But the reality of places
like KIPP is a good deal less glamorous than that. To get a sense of what 50 to 60 percent more
learning time means, listen to the typical day in the life of a KIPP student.
The student's name is Marita. She's an only child who lives in a single-parent home. Her mother
never went to college. The two of them share a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx. Marita
used to go to a parochial school down the street from her home, until her mother heard of
KIPP. “When I was in fourth grade, me and one of my other friends, Tanya, we both applied to
KIPP,” Marita said. “I remember Miss Owens. She interviewed me, and the way she was saying
made it sound so hard I thought I was going to prison. I almost started crying. And she was like,
If you don't want to sign this, you don't have to sign this. But then my mom was right there, so I
Page 116/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
signed it.”
W ith that, her life changed. (Keep in mind, while reading what follows, that Marita is twelve
years old.)
“I wake up at five-forty-five a.m. to get a head start,” she says. “I brush my teeth, shower. I get
some breakfast at school, if I am running late. Usually get yelled at because I am taking too long.
I meet my friends Diana and Steven at the bus stop, and we get the number one bus.”
A 5:45 wakeup is fairly typical of KIPP students, especially given the long bus and subway
commutes that many have to get to school. Levin, at one point, went into a seventh-grade music
class with seventy kids in it and asked for a show of hands on when the students woke up. A
handful said they woke up after six. Three quarters said they woke up before six. And almost
half said they woke up before 5:30. One classmate of Marital, a boy named Jose, said he
sometimes wakes up at three or four a.m., finishes his homework from the night before, and
then “goes back to sleep for a bit.”
Marita went on:
I leave school at five p.m., and if I don't lollygag around, then I will get home around five-thirty.
Then I say hi to my mom really quickly and start my homework. And if it's not a lot of
homework that day, it will take me two to three hours, and I'll be done around nine p.m. Or if
we have essays, then I will be done like ten p.m., or tenthirty p.m.
Sometimes my mom makes me break for dinner. I tell her I want to go straight through, but she
says I have to eat. So around eight, she makes me break for dinner for, like, a half hour, and
then I get back to work. Then, usually after that, my mom wants to hear about school,
but I have to make it quick because I have to get in bed by eleven p.m. So I get all my stuff
ready, and then I get into bed. I tell her all about the day and what happened, and by the time
we are finished, she is on the brink of sleeping, so that's probably around eleven-fifteen. Then I
go to sleep, and the next morning we do it all over again. We are in the same room. But it's a
huge bedroom and you can split it into two, and we have beds on other sides. Me and my mom
are very close.
She spoke in the matter-of-fact way of children who have no way of knowing how unusual their
situation is. She had the hours of a lawyer trying to make partner, or of a medical resident. All
that was missing were the dark circles under her eyes and a steaming cup of coffee, except that
she was too young for either.
“Sometimes I don't go to sleep when I'm supposed to,” Marita continued. “I go to sleep at, like,
twelve o'clock, and the next afternoon, it will hit me. And I will doze off in class. But then I have
to wake up because I have to get the information. I remember I was in one class, and I was
dozing off and the teacher saw me and said, 'Can I talk to you after class?' And he asked me,
'Why were you dozing off?' And I told him I went to sleep late. And he was, like, 'You need to
go to sleep earlier.' ”
Marita's life is not the life of a typical twelve-year-old. Nor is it what we would necessarily wish
for a twelve-yearold. Children, we like to believe, should have time to play and dream and sleep.
Page 117/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Marita has responsibilities. What is being asked of her is the same thing that was asked of the
Korean pilots. To become a success at what they did, they had to shed some part of their own
identity, because the deep respect for authority that runs throughout Korean culture simply does
not work in the cockpit. Marita has had to do the same because the cultural legacy she had been
given does not match her circumstances eithernot when middleand upper-middle-class families
are using weekends and summer vacation to push their children ahead. Her community does
not give her what she needs. So what does she have to doGive up her evenings and weekends
and friendsall the elements of her old worldand replace then with KIPP.
Here is Marita again, in a passage that is little short of heartbreaking:
Well, when we first started fifth grade, I used to have contact with one of the girls from my old
school, and whenever I left school on Friday, I would go to her house and stay there until my
mom would get home from work. So I would be at her house and I would be doing my
homework. She would never have any homework. And she would say, “Oh, my God, you stay
there late.” Then she said she wanted to go to KIPP, but then she would say that KIPP is too
hard and she didn't want to do it. And I would say, “Everyone says that KIPP is hard, but once
you get the hang of it, it's not really that hard.” She told me, “It's because you are smart.” And I
said, “No, every one of us is smart.” And she was so discouraged because we stayed until five
and we had a lot of homework, and I told her that us having a lot of homework helps us do
better in class. And she told me she didn't want to hear the whole speech. All my friends now
are from KIPP.
Is this a lot to ask of a childIt is. But think of things from Marita's perspective. She has made a
bargain with her school. She will get up at five-forty-five in the morning, go in on Saturdays, and
do homework until eleven at night. In return, KIPP promises that it will take kids like her who
are stuck in poverty and give them a chance to get out. It will get 84 percent of them up to or
above their grade level in mathematics. On the strength of that performance, 90 percent of
KIPP students get scholarships to private or parochial high schools instead of having to attend
their own desultory high schools in the Bronx. And on the strength of that high school
experience, more than 80 percent of KIPP graduates will go on to college, in many cases being
the first in their family to do so.
How could that be a bad bargainEverything we have learned in Outliers says that success follows
a predictable course. It is not the brightest who succeed. If it were, Chris Langan would be up
there with Einstein. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our
own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunitiesand who
have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. For hockey and soccer players born
in January, it's a better shot at making the all-star team. For the Beatles, it was Hamburg. For
Bill Gates, the lucky break was being born at the right time and getting the gift of a computer
terminal in junior high. Joe Flom and the founders of Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz got multiple breaks. They were born at the right time with the right
parents and the right ethnicity, which allowed them to practice takeover law for twenty years
before the rest of the legal world caught on. And what Korean Air did, when it finally turned its
operations around, was give its pilots the opportunity to escape the constraints of their cultural
legacy.
Page 118/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
The lesson here is very simple. But it is striking how often it is overlooked. We are so caught in
the myths of the best and the brightest and the self-made that we think outliers spring naturally
from the earth. We look at the young Bill Gates and marvel that our world allowed that thirteenyear-old to become a fabulously successful entrepreneur. But that's the wrong lesson. Our world
only allowed one thirteen-year-old unlimited access to a time sharing terminal in 1968. If a
million teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more Microsofts would we
have todayTo build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and
arbitrary advantages that today determine successthe fortunate birth dates and the happy
accidents of historywith a society that provides opportunities for all. If Canada had a second
hockey league for those children born in the last half of the year, it would today have twice as
many adult hockey stars. Now multiply that sudden flowering of talent by every field and
profession. The world could be so much richer than the world we have settled for.
Marita doesn't need a brand-new school with acres of playing fields and gleaming facilities. She
doesn't need a laptop, a smaller class, a teacher with a PhD, or a big ger apartment. She
doesn't need a higher IQ or a mind as quick as Chris Langan's. All those things would be nice,
of course. But they miss the point. Marita just needed a chance. And look at the chance she was
given! Someone brought a little bit of the rice paddy to the South Bronx and explained to her
the miracle of meaningful work.

EPILOGUE
AJamaican Story “IF A PROGENY OF YOUNG COLORED CHILDREN IS BROUGHT
FORTH, THESE ARE EMANCIPATED.”
On September 9, 1931, a young woman named Daisy Nation gave birth to twin girls. She and
her husband, Donald, were schoolteachers in a tiny village called Harewood, in the central
Jamaican parish of Saint Catherine's. They named their daughters Faith and Joyce. When
Donald was told that he had fathered twins, he sank down on his knees and surrendered
responsibility for their lives over to God.
The Nations lived in a small cottage on the grounds of Harewood's Anglican church. The
schoolhouse was next door, a long, single-room barn of a building raised on concrete stilts. On
some days, there might be as many as three hundred children in the room, and on others, less
than two dozen. The children would read out loud or recite their times tables. Writing was done
on slates. Whenever possible, the classes would move outside, under the mango trees. If the
children were out of control, Donald Nation would walk from one end of the room to the other,
waving a strap from left to right as the children scrambled back to their places.
He was an imposing man, quiet and dignified, and a great lover of books. In his small library
were works of poetry and philosophy and novels by such writers as Somerset Maugham. Every
day he would read the newspaper closely, following the course of the events around the word.
In the evening, his best friend, Archdeacon Hay, the Anglican pastor who lived on the other
side of the hill, would come over and sit on Donald's veranda, and together they would expound
on the problems of Jamaica. Donald's wife, Daisy, was from the parish of Saint Elizabeth. Her
maiden name was Ford, and her father had owned a small grocery store. She was one of three
sisters, and she was renowned for her beauty.
At the age of eleven, the twins won scholarships to a boarding school called Saint Hilda's near
the north coast. It was an old Anglican private school, established for the daughters of English
clergy, property owners, and overseers. From Saint Hilda's they applied and were accepted to
University College,in London. Not long afterward, Joyce went to a twenty-first-birthday party for
a young English mathematician named Graham. He stood up to recite a poem and forgot his
lines, and Joyce became embarrassed for himeven though it made no sense for her to feel
embarrassed, because she did not know him at all. Joyce and Graham fell in love and got
married. They moved to Canada. Graham was a math professor. Joyce became a successful
writer and a family therapist. They had three sons and built a beautiful house on a hill, off in the
countryside. Graham's last name is Gladwell. He is my father, and Joyce Gladwell is my mother.
That is the story of my mother's path to successand it isn't true. It's not a lie in the sense that
the facts were made up. But it is false in the way that telling the story of Bill Gates without
mentioning the computer at Lakeside is false, or accounting for Asian math prowess without
going back to the rice paddies is false. It leaves out my mother's many opportunities and the
importance of her cultural legacy.
Page 120/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
In 1935, for example, when my mother and her sister were four, a historian named William M.
MacMillan visited Jamaica. He was a professor at the University of Witwatersrand in
Johannesburg, South Africa. MacMillan was a man before his time: he was deeply concerned
with the social problems of South Africa's black population, and he came to the Caribbean to
make the same argument he had made back home in South Africa.
Chief among MacMillan's concerns was Jamaica's educational system. Formal schoolingif you
could call what happened in the wooden barn next door to my grandparents' house “formal
schooling”went only to fourteen years of age. Jamaica had no public high schools or universities.
Those with academic inclinations took extra classes with the head teacher in their teenage years
and with luck made it into teachers' college. Those with broader ambitions had to somehow find
their way into a private school,
and from there to a university in the United States or England.
But scholarships were few and far between, and the cost of private schooling was prohibitive for
all but a privileged few. The “bridge from the primary schools” to high school, MacMillan later
wrote, in a blistering critique of England's treatment of its colonies entitled Warning from the
West Indies, “is narrow and insecure.” The school system did nothing for the “humblest” classes.
He went on: “ I f anything these schools are a factor deepening and sharpening social
distinctions.” If the government did not give its people opportunities, he warned, there would be
trouble.
A year after MacMillan published his book, a wave of riots and unrest swept the Caribbean.
Fourteen people were killed and fifty-nine injured in Trinidad. Fourteen were killed and fortyseven injured in Barbados. In Jamaica, a series of violent strikes shut down the country, and a
state of emergency was declared. Panicked, the British government took MacMillan's
prescriptions to heart and, among other reforms, proposed a series of “allisland” scholarships
for academically minded students to go to private high schools. The scholarships began in 1941.
My mother and her twin sister sat for the exam the following year. That is how they got a high
school education; had they been born two or three or four years earlier, they might never have
gotten a full education. My mother owes the course her life took to the timing of her birth, to
the rioters of 1937, and to W. M. MacMillan.
I described Daisy Nation, my grandmother, as “renowned for her beauty.” But the truth is that
was a careless and condescending way to describe her. She was a force. The fact that my
mother and her sister left Harewood for Saint Hilda's was my grandmother's doing. My
grandfather may have been an imposing and learned man, but he was an idealist and a dreamer.
He buried himself in his books. If he had ambitions for his daughters, he did not have the
foresight and energy to make them real. My grandmother did. Saint Hilda's was her idea: some
of the wealthier families in the area sent their daughters there, and she saw what a good school
meant. Her daughters did not play with the other children of the village. They read. Latin and
algebra were necessary for high school, so she had her daughters tutored by Archdeacon Hay.
“If you'd asked her about her goals for her children, she would have said she wanted us out of
there,” my mother recalls. “She didn't feel that the Jamaican context offered enough. And if the
opportunity was there to go on, and you were able to take it, then to her the sky was the limit.”
Page 121/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
When the results came back from the scholarship exam, only my aunt was awarded a
scholarship. My mother was not. That's another fact that my first history was careless about. My
mother remembers her parents standing in the doorway, talking to each other. “W e have no
more money.” They had paid the tuition for the first term and bought the uniforms and had
exhausted their savings. What would they do when the second-term fees for my mother came
dueBut then again, they couldn't send one daughter and not the other. My grandmother was
steadfast. She sent bothand prayed and at the end of the first term, it turned out that one of the
other girls at the school had won two scholarships, so the second was given to my mother.
When it came time to go to university, my aunt, the academic twin, won what was called a
Centenary Scholarship. The “Centenary” was a reference to the fact that the scholarship was
established one hundred years after the abolition of slavery in Jamaica. It was reserved for the
graduates of public elementary schools, and, in a measure of how deeply the British felt about
honoring the memory of abolition, there was a total of one Centenary scholarship awarded
every year for the whole island, with the prize going to the top girl and the top boy in
alternating years. The year my aunt applied was one of the “girl” years. She was lucky. My
mother was not. My mother was faced with the cost of passage to England, room and board and
living expenses, and tuition at the University of London. To get a sense of how daunting that
figure was, the value of the Centenary scholarship my aunt won was probably as much as the
sum of my grandparents' annual salaries. There were no student loan programs, no banks with
lines of credit for schoolteachers out in the countryside. “If I'd asked my father,” my mother
says, “he would have replied, 'We have no money/ ”
What did Daisy doShe went to the Chinese shopkeeper in a neighboring town. Jamaica has a
very large Chinese population that since the nineteenth century has dominated the commercial
life of the island. In Jamaican parlance, a store is not a store, it is a “Chinee-shop.” Daisy went
to the “Chinee-shop,” to Mr. Chance, and borrowed the money. No one knows how much she
borrowed, although it must have been an enormous sum. And no one knows why Mr. Chance
lent it to Daisy, except of course that she was Daisy Nation, and she paid her bills promptly and
had taught the Chance children at Harewood School. It was not always easy to be a Chinese
child in aJamaican schoolyard. The Jamaican children would taunt the Chinese children.
“Chinee nyan [eat] dog.” Daisy was a kindly and beloved figure, an oasis amid that hostility. Mr.
Chance may have felt in her debt.
“Did she tell me what she was doingI didn't even ask her,” my mother remembers. “It just
occurred. I just applied to university and got in. I acted completely on faith that I could rely on
my mother, without even realizing that I was relying on my mother.”
Joyce Gladwell owes her college education first to W. M. MacMillan, and then to the student at
Saint Hilda's who gave up her scholarship, and then to Mr. Chance, and then, most of all, to
Daisy Nation.
Daisy Nation was from the northwestern end of Jamaica. Her great-grandfather was William
Ford. He was from Ireland, and he arrived in Jamaica in 1784 having bought a coffee
plantation. Not long after his arrival, he bought a slave woman and took her as his concubine.
He noticed her on the docks at Alligator Pond, a fishing village on the south coast. She was an
Igbo tribeswoman from West Africa. They had a son, whom they named John. He was, in the
language of the day, a “mulatto”; he was coloredand all of the Fords from that point on fell into

Jamaica's colored class.
In the American South during that same period, it would have been highly unusual for a white
landowner to have such a public relationship with a slave. Sexual relations between whites and
blacks were considered morally repugnant. Laws were passed prohibiting miscegenation, the
last of which were not struck down by the U S Supreme Court until 1967. A plantation owner
who lived openly with a slave woman would have been socially ostracized, and any offspring
from the union of black and white would have been left in slavery.
In Jamaica, attitudes were very different. The Caribbean in those years was little more than a
massive slave colony. Blacks outnumbered whites by a ratio of more than ten to one. There
were few, if any, marriageable white women, and as a result, the overwhelming majority of
white men in the West Indies had black or brown mistresses. One British plantation owner in
Jamaica who famously kept a precise diary of his sexual exploits slept with 138 different women
in his thirty-seven years on the island, almost all of them slaves and, one suspects, not all of
them willing partners. A nd whites saw mulattoesthe children of those relationships as potential
allies, a buffer between them and the enormous numbers of slaves on the island. Mulatto
women were prized as mistresses, and their children, one shade lighter in turn, moved still
further up the social and economic ladder. Mulattoes rarely worked in the fields. They lived the
much easier life of working in the “house.” They were the ones most likely to be freed. So
many mulatto mistresses were left substantial fortunes in the wills of white property owners that
the Jamaica legislature once passed a law capping bequests at two thousand pounds (which, at
the time, was an enormous sum).
“When a European arrives in the West Indies and gets settled or set down for any length of
time, he finds it necessary to provide himself with a housekeeper or mistress,” one eighteenthcentury observer wrote. “The choice he has an opportunity of making is various, a black, a
tawney, a mulatto or a mestee, one of which can be purchased for ioo or 150 sterling If a
progeny of young colored children is brought forth, these are emancipated, and mostly sent by
those fathers who can afford it, at the age of three or four years, to be educated in England.”
This is the world Daisy's grandfather John was born into. He was one generation removed from
a slave ship, living in a country best described as an African penal colony, and he was a free
man, with every benefit of education. He married another mulatto, a woman who was half
European and half Arawak, which is the Indian tribe indigenous to Jamaica, and had seven
children.
“These peoplethe coloredshad a lot of status,” the Jamaican sociologist Orlando Patterson says.
"By eighteen twenty-six, they had full civil liberties. In fact, they achieve full civil liberties at the
same time as the Jews do in Jamaica. They could vote. Do anything a white person could do
and this is within the context of what was still a slave society.
“Ideally, they would try to be artisans. Remember, Jamaica has sugar plantations, which are very
different from the cotton plantations you find in the American South. Cotton is a predominantly
agricultural pursuit. You are picking this stuff, and almost all of the processing was done in
Lancashire, or the North. Sugar is an agroindustrial complex. You have to have the factory right
there, because sugar starts losing sucrose within hours of being picked. You had no choice but
to have the sugar mill right there, and sugar mills require a wide range of occupations. The
Page 123/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
coopers. The boiler men. The carpentersand a lot of those jobs were filled by colored people.”
It was also the case that Jamaica's English elite, unlike their counterparts in the United States,
had little interest in the grand project of nation building. They wanted to make their money and
go back to England. They had no desire to stay in what they considered a hostile land. So the
task of building a new societywith the many opportunities it embodiedfell to the coloreds as well.
“By eighteen fifty, the mayor of Kingston [the Jamaican capital] was a colored person,”
Patterson went on. “And so was the founder of the Daily Gleaner [Jamaica's major newspaper].
These were colored people, and from very early on, they came to dominate the professional
classes. The whites were involved in business or the plan tation. The people who became
doctors and lawyers were these colored people. These were the people running the schools.
The bishop of Kingston was a classic brown man. They weren't the economic elite. But they
were the cultural elite.”
The chart below shows a breakdown of two categories of Jamaican professionalslawyers and
members of parliamentin the early 1950s. The categorization is by skin tone. “White and light”
refers to people who are either entirely white or, more likely, who have some black heritage
that is no longer readily apparent. “Olive” is one Lawyers (percentage)

below olive (although the difference between those two shades might not be readily apparent to
anyone but a Jamaican). The fact to keep in mind is that in the 1950s “blacks” made up about
80 percent of the Jamaican population, outnumbering coloreds five to one.
Look at the extraordinary advantage that their little bit of whiteness gave the colored minority.
Having an ancestor who worked in the house and not in the fields, who got full civil rights in
1826, who was valued instead of enslaved, who got a shot at meaningful work instead of being
consigned to the sugarcane fields, made all the difference in occupational success two and three
generations later.
Daisy Ford's ambition for her daughters did not come from nowhere, in other words. She was
the inheritor of a legacy of privilege. Her older brother Rufus,
with whom she went to live as a child, was a teacher and a man of learning. Her brother Carlos
went to Cuba and then came back to Jamaica and opened a garment factory. Her father,
Charles Ford, was a produce wholesaler. Her mother, Ann, was a Powell, another educated,
upwardly mobile colored familyand the same Powells who would two generations later produce
Colin Powell. Her uncle Henry owned property. Her grandfather Johnthe son of William Ford
and his African concubinebecame a preacher. No less than three members of the extended Ford
family ended up winning Rhodes Scholarships.If my mother owed W. M. MacMillan and the
rioters of 1937 and Mr. Chance and her mother, Daisy Ford, then Daisy owed Rufus and Carlos
and Ann and Charles and John.
My grandmother was a remarkable woman. But it is important to remember that the steady
upward path upon which the Fords embarked began with a morally complicated act: William
Page 124/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
Ford looked upon my great-great-greatgrandmother with desire at a slave market in Alligator
Pond and purchased her.
The slaves who were not so chosen had short and unhappy lives. In Jamaica, the plantation
owners felt it made the most sense to extract the maximum possible effort from their human
property while the property was still youngto work their slaves until they were either useless or
deadand then simply buy another round at the market. They had no trouble with the
philosophical contradiction of cherishing the children they had with a slave and simultaneously
thinking of slaves as property. William Thistlewood, the plantation owner who cataloged his
sexual exploits, had a lifelong relationship with a slave named Phibbah, whom, by all accounts,
he adored, and who bore him a son. But to his “field” slaves, he was a monster, whose
preferred punishment for those who tried to run away was what he called “Derby's dose.” The
runaway would be beaten, and salt pickle, lime juice, and bird pepper would be rubbed into his
or her open wounds. Another slave would defecate into the mouth of the miscreant, who would
then be gagged for four to five hours.
It is not surprising, then, that the brown-skinned classes of Jamaica came to fetishize their
lightness. It was their great advantage. They scrutinized the shade of one another's skin and
played the color game as ruthlessly in the end as the whites did. “If, as often happens, children
are of different shades of color in a family,” the Jamaican sociologist Fernando Henriques once
wrote:
the most lightly colored will be favored at the expense of the others. In adolescence, and until
marriage, the darker members of the family will be kept out of the way when the friends of the
fair or fairer members of the family are being entertained. The fair child is regarded as raising
the color of the family and nothing must be put in the way of its success, that is in the way of a
marriage which will still further raise the color status of the family. A fair person will try to sever
social relations he may have with darker relatives... the darker members of a Negro family will
encourage the efforts of a very fair relative to “pass” for White. The practices of intra-family
relations lay the foun dation for the public manifestation of color prejudice.
My family was not immune to this. Daisy was inordinately proud of the fact her husband was
lighter than she was. But that same prejudice was then turned on her: “Daisy's nice, you know,”
her mother-in-law would say, “but she's too dark.”
One of my mother's relatives (I'll call her Aunt Joan) was also well up the color totem pole. She
was “white and light.” But her husband was what in Jamaica is called an “Injun” a man with a
dark complexion and straight, fine black hairand their daughters were dark like their father. One
day, after her husband had died, she was traveling on a train to visit her daughter, and she met
and took an interest in a light-skinned man in the same railway car. What happened next is
something that Aunt Joan told only my mother, years later, with the greatest of shame. When
she got off the train, she walked right by her daughter, disowning her own flesh and blood,
because she did not want a man so light-skinned and desirable to know that she had borne a
daughter so dark.
In the 1960s, my mother wrote a book about her experiences. It was entitled Brown Face, Big
Master, the “brown face” referring to herself, and the “big master” referring, in the Jamaican
dialect, to God. At one point, she describes a time just after my parents were married when
Page 125/126 http://motsach.infoOutliers: The Story of Success Malcolm Gladwell
they were living in London and my eldest brother was still a baby. They were looking for an
apartment, and after a long search, my father found one in a London suburb. On the day after
they moved in, however, the landlady ordered them out. “You didn't tell me your wife was
Jamaican,” she told my father in a rage. In her book, my mother describes her long struggle to
make sense of this humiliation, to reconcile her experience with her faith. In the end, she was
forced to acknowledge that anger was not an option and that as a colored Jamai can whose
family had benefited for generations from the hierarchy of race, she could hardly reproach
another for the impulse to divide people by the shade of their skin:
I complained to God in so many words: “Here I was, the wounded representative of the negro
race in our struggle to be accounted free and equal with the dominating whites!” And God was
amused; my prayer did not ring true with Him. I would try again. And then God said, “Have you
not done the same thingRemember this one and that one, people whom you have slighted or
avoided or treated less considerately than others because they were different superficially, and
you were ashamed to be identified with them. Have you not been glad that you are not more
colored than you areGrateful that you are not black?” My anger and hate against the landlady
melted. I was no better than she was, nor worse for that matter We were both guilty of the sin
of self-regard, the pride and the exclusiveness by which we cut some people off from ourselves.
It is not easy to be so honest about where we're from. It would be simpler for my mother to
portray her success as a straightforward triumph over victimhood, just as it would be simpler to
look at Joe Flom and call him the greatest lawyer evereven though his individual achievements
are so impossibly intertwined with his ethnicity, his generation, the particulars of the garment
industry, and the peculiar biases of the downtown law firms. Bill Gates could accept the title of
genius, and leave it at that. It takes no small degree of humility for him to look back on his life
and say, “I was very lucky.” And he was. The Mothers' Club of Lakeside Academy bought him a
computer in 1968. It is impossible for a hockey player, or Bill Joy, or Robert Oppenheimer, or
any other outlier for that matter, to look down from their lofty perch and say with truthfulness, “I
did this, all by myself.” Superstar lawyers and math whizzes and software entrepreneurs appear
at first blush to lie outside ordinary experience. But they don't. They are products of history and
community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is
grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned,
some just plain luckybut all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not
an outlier at all.
My great-great-great-grandmother was bought at Alligator Pond. That act, in turn, gave her son,
John Ford, the privilege of a skin color that spared him a life of slavery. The culture of possibility
that Daisy Ford embraced and put to use so brilliantly on behalf of her daughters was passed on
to her by the peculiarities of the West Indian social structure. And my mother's education was
the product of the riots of 1937 and the industriousness of Mr. Chance. These were history's
gifts to my familyand if the resources of that grocer, the fruits of those riots, the possibilities of
that culture, and the privileges of that skin tone had been extended to others, how many more
would now live a life of fulfillment, in a beautiful house high on a hill?
