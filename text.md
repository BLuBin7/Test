In January of 1882, a group of eleven Rosetansten men and one boyset sail for New York.
They spent their first night in America sleeping on the floor of a tavern on Mulberry Street, in
Manhattan's Little Italy. Then they ventured west, eventually finding jobs in a slate quarry ninety
miles west of the city near the town of Bangor, Pennsylvania. The following year, fifteen
Rosetans left Italy for America, and several members of that group ended up in Bangor as well,
joining their compatriots in the slate quarry. Those immigrants, in turn, sent word back to
Roseto about the promise of the New World, and soon one group of Rosetans after another
packed their bags and headed for Pennsylvania, until the initial stream of immigrants became a
flood. In 1894 alone, some twelve hundred Rosetans applied for passports to America, leaving
entire streets of their old village abandoned
